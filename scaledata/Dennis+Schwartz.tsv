but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned .when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts .bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .	0
you can watch this movie , that is based on a sci-fi work by robert heinlein , either as a straight gung-ho war film , or you can see it mostly as a spoof .i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation .after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military .	0
this is asking a lot to believe , and though it is possible , it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch , because he sure couldn't act , and since he is the focal point of all the attention , able to have his way with either men or women , we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen , instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldn't see it .i'm afraid i don't have the answer , since i can't find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it , as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle , and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background , which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself , even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers , and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert , who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career , but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance .there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing , when at a fashion party for dominque's wealthy parisian fashion clients , quentin tells her , " seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke . "	0
he tries every bit he could muster from the lore of gangster and screwball comedies , to make this film work , but still misses by a city mile .the plot has its twists and turns , and it would serve no purpose telling you about it , since the heart of the film , is about the surprises and corpses it delivers .since the film's humor didn't suit me and i grew tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie , with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of stereotypes ; and , the violence didn't particularly appeal to me , either , leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure .	0
it is perfect for the mall , where teenagers experiencing brain drains can feel good about being mindless and not have to apologize that this is an american film , about that old cliche of young lovers relentlessly on the run .though it would have been good comedic dialogue to have the two leads , lola ( franka potente ) and manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) , try to resolve these deep philosophical questions .what does take place is a soccer ball being kicked to open the action in the film , as the movie is supposed to be like a game , with the director making up the rules as he goes along .	0
the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible , it is just bad filmmaking ; but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it , for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray .the fault of the film , is that beatty can't gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it , like he's the white man who knows best what to do , and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor ( sic ) .just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw , along comes this sophomoric venture , showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new so-called truths , and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in silliness and prattle , unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected , except what is implied , that the people will trust him because he's so hip and daring , and he's just so with it .	0
for the first 30 minutes or so i felt i was stuck in a detention classroom for dummies ( ah !if the film was funny or its technology was more interesting , or if the killings weren't so melodramatic , and the acting not so staid , and the patriotic jingoism wasn't so shrill , i might have found this film bearable .but since that wasn't the case , i found the film to be an academic bore .	0
he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some " summer script " he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie .that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care .to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person .	0
the kid plays his part like he's a lump of coal and the sex is so uninviting , making it seem just as boring as watching paint dry on a wall .the sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of helen , but the menage a trois doesn't have the nuances , wit , or actors to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away with .it was just a dull , exploitive movie , distinguished only by the fine performance of a good actor , pete postlethwaite , who was overwhelmed by being in such a trying film .	0
but that's not to say that the film was so terrible that it can't be seen , that would not be true , since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull that it negates any enjoyment value .but what was really laughable , was the filmmaker's bourgeois conception of what a bohemian is .the film was able to muster one great line of dialogue , and it comes from marion , as she tells her hapless hubby , " you will get married because you are not original enough not to . "	0
it is so ridiculous and incredulous that the filmmaker completely ruins washington irving's great short story .this film has box office appeal as a date movie for the high school set , comforting each other as they snack on popcorn ( which the theater owners will be largely appreciative of ) , and the teens , in all probability , will be reacting with bemused glee or mock horror to all the packets of ketchup unleashed during the headless horseman's romp through the sleepy hollow of 1799 .it's best to forget about this movie as in any way connected with the novel , the only thing that seems to jive is the time period , the location , and the character called ichabod crane ( depp ) .	0
this one is a yawner , one in which i found it difficult to sit through , as its two hours of belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that ; and , it was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's inane indulgent musings on religion , as he tries to gross the audience out with foul language , sight gags of unpleasant sights , such as a pile of shit emerging from a toilet bowl , and an irrelevant premise for an argument against catholicism , an argument that is about as crude a one as i have heard in some time .the filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious argument with one of silliness , spending most of his time lecturing and moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of view , as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing , that there is politics in the catholic church .fiorentino and rickman are flat and unconvincing in their roles , getting neither comedy nor drama out of their performance , just giving me a mild headache listening to them deliver their vacuous lines .	0
the first-time actress who was chosen as a result of a national talent search for a newcomer for the part , was won by the iowa teen-ager , jean seberg , who doesn't have whatever inner strength it takes to be joan of arc , at least she doesn't have it at this point of her career , and should have not been cast in that part ; her shrill voice does not make for a naive peasant girl who hears the voice of god , nor does the closing of her eyes portend that she is a visionary .he appeared to be ridiculous emoting in his spastic gestures at the camera , as if he was in the wrong film and didn't understand that this one wasn't meant to be a comedy .it was an exercise in futility and arrogance on the part of the director , a thumbing his nose at anyone who disagrees that he is a great filmmaker and that he could make any type of film .	0
though it does drag on for an excrutiatingly embarrassing forty more minutes , until it predictably shows harper overcoming her problems of feeling inadequate .the film heads down a road of corn ball contrivances , that kill any chance for this story to be taken seriously .polley is a fine actress and her performance when first encountering sex , is one of nervous apprehension and childish giggles .	0
it suffers from wooden acting , flat direction , and trite dialogue .it was as if huston was reading his lines from cue cards , which made his confrontations with sherlock unduly dry .what the film did have going for it , was a clever plot and a few gimmicks it hung its hat on , which made it passably interesting for awhile , at least enough for me to continue watching so i could see how sherlock resolves the complicated case he is working on .	0
to make up for not coming prepared with a script that made sense , a stellar cast was hired but then was asked to do nothing , instead some gorgeous vintage cars were put on display and each was given a girl's name .everything about the story was kept hyper , as mindless violence won out over gratuitous sex , to become the major selling point of this exploitive film .the thrill of the film now becomes in watching the crew be selected , which includes angelina jolie , chi mcbride , james duval , and scott caan , none of whom are in the least bit interesting or funny .	0
it was an unbearably dull and simplistic film : poorly acted and with a vile and inaccurate depiction of jews , the scenery consisted of gaudy tv stage sets , and there was just no emotion drawn from the story .he made a few more fascist-commissioned films and in 1943 he shot desiderio , which was a precursor of his trademarked neorealist style to come later .rossellini also took the religion out of jesus and made the rabbi seem as if he was merely a moralist , who was more a humanitarian and a mr .	0
everything about this film is a sham , from the repulsive bar it highlights to the inane relationship it features .it felt like i was dropped into a pit with some of the most obnoxious types you would ever want to meet and was told that the only way to get out of this trap , was to shake my ass like they do .an actor could only hope to come out of a film like this unscathed , that piper perabo does , is a credit to her , which is probably due to the innocent kindergarten teacher look she conveys .	0
the director of this film , jan de bont ( speed/speed 2/ twister ) , is not up to dealing with a psychological story and directing characters in a persuasive way , he is more into making silly theme movies that rely solely on special effects .it's all hokum from beginning to end , and it is so poorly scripted , that tedium quickly sets in , leaving the film with no purpose except to be laughed at for how stupid it all is .since this thriller was never thrilling , it just went on to show off the stage set designs illustriously created by eugenio zanetti , all one could do was go from room to room and stare at the cherubs , the leaping skeletons , the elaborately built stairway collapsing , an animated hand of a ghost coming out of the fountain , and at the futile effort to make a disney fantasy picture .	0
the debut feature of jamie babbit is unabashedly awkward and to make matters worse , she can't get the cast to stop mugging for the camera .his exaggerated gait and suppresed gay tendencies never materialized as funny stuff , just a bad script he was stuck with which was made more unbearable by his obnoxious performance .she seemed to be going for the hammy sweetness she thought her role required and when the comedy part of the film was over and she had hot pants for graham , there was no spark on the screen to give the affair any life .	0
the film suffers from an interminable case of blandness and exhibits an unwillingness to go beyond its cute little tale to see the dangers of someone who invades another's personal privacy by pretending to be someone he isn't , especially in a critical field such as the mental health one .this film was so weak and misleading in purpose , its story so dry and unconvincing , that it was a chore to just watch it and not give up on its arrogant attitude .this was a film made up of phony characters , whose problems were surface deep and were covered in the most superficial of ways .	0
the director has gone after style and has thrown substance out the window , as the film follows this war of words as it escalates into an ugly scene of macho posturing and then into gore .the protagonists were three unlikable snobs , concerned with their image , talking about name-brand products as if someone was an idiot who didn't adhere to their tastes , and getting into the tussle because they were loudly attacking the other table for being tacky .shundo ohkawa's direction is meant to be glossy , high-tech , but suffers from being amateurish and outdated , overrun with trick camera shots to capture the violence .	0
there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny .lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story .var's " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face .	0
which makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining .mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 .with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult .	0
the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . 'wayne wang's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey .but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .	0
i grew nauseous from how bourgeois this film was in attitude , where even the rebels are merely lovers of sweet things .it was a labor just to sit through it and not gag , while waiting for the inevitable preachy sermon that comes at the end , so even the church is redeemed for its unchristian attitude toward strangers .lasse hallstrom has come down a few pegs after his more engaging recent films " my life as a dog " and " the cider house rules , " as he couldn't pull this fairy tale off without being tainted by the mediocrity of it all .	0
this fine ensemble cast is stuck in an unwieldy production , where characters have a lost look in their eyes .the film sets for itself some lofty themes -- destiny , fate , mortality -- which are never fully explored with any depth , as the story describes the lives of some toronto citizens 12 hours before a bloody shooting spree in a trendy coffee shop .the film's strategy is to show how one can change their plans and either avert a catastrophe or run right into it , which is hardly a fresh premise .	0
in this less than routine thriller , the cops and a philanthropist are the bad guys .every character was one-dimensional , the story line was crass , the directing was more suited for a tv show than a feature film , the acting was stiff , and the cinematography was unimaginative .i can't think of one thing i liked about the film .	0
garland is one stupid lady in this film .the two things that are positive about the film are : beverly garland is a looker and the film is an oddity .but this film is only for beverly garland fans , which i count myself as an unofficial member .	0
the result is a predictably boring film which neatly ties up all the loose ends by its conclusion , whose heart lies where the schmaltz is .the film appears to be one big advertisement for the giant department store and its generosity to its trailer park clientele .director williams , he once directed the roseanne tv show , uses the material adapted from billie letts' best-selling novel to keep everything as dumb as he can .	0
by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting .director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster .and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production .	0
susan granger's review of " the musketeer " ( universal pictures ) hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay .filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts .as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill .	0
it's an exploitation teen movie with no redeeming social or entertainment value .it also fails to deliver any messages , to raise social consciousness , or to succeed as an artistic film .it's just a badly scripted and acted film , that by being so terrible might provide a few chuckles for the discrete viewer who likes looking through trash .	0
it offers hollywood's silly response to the 1950s red scare sweeping the country and promoted by the mccarthy senate hearings looking for commies under every bed cover .to realize how dumb this cold war film is , try this summation of the plot on for size : can it be that the martians are signaling earth and that their leader is that actually uttering the very word of god ?this is one of those really bad propaganda films that has no entertainment value , as it shows how paranoic this country can be and how it can use religion at the drop of a radio signal to promote materialism and christianity as a superior way of life than communism .	0
this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo , where we see crime , ugly buildings , the subway , and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country .the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off , everything he touches he fouls up , a complete loser-- there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy .but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that , it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story , a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film , we can no longer be content to relax , laughing at this inept mailman , we have to now see how he handles himself under fire , while the director , also , tries to bring romance into the story .	0
wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you .the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film .the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation .	0
too many other things about the movie were either murky or didn't add up , unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable .what worked for me , was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta , it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns .he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor .	0
this rambling , marathon of an epic movie , aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer , erupting for a few electrifying scenes , and going on for what seemed an eternity , to tell the 50 years of yugoslavian history by dividing it into 3 parts : the german invasion in 1941 , the cold war-tito socialist state period , and the ethnic cleansing and war period in 1991 .a film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals , which i understand to be political jibes , but i still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny .all the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over , along with the filmmaker's yearning for a unified country , this is done an unnecessary amount of times , until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme .	0
therefore the animated george of the first half of the film , is reduced to being a passive tourist , everyone showing him a thing or two about their country , and the film flounders , caught between a soft romance and a soft political treatise , accomplishing neither one very successfully .george does the sensible thing for a highly emotional person to do , he splits from here and heads for glasgow , supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the contras are by his unexpected adventure .but it was pleasant to watch oyanka cabezas , she was quite innocently alluring , giving her role an authentic tone to it , as there were moments when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say , and that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause .	0
well , this cure might work on film , and who knows , this information might have some medical merit that i am not aware of , but as part of the plot , stefan as the healer , ingratiating himself with the composer to break his musical silence and give it all for the world of music , started to give me a headache , as it reminded me of all the formula films of this nature that i have sat through in the past , thinking that this easily could have been the theme of a sports film or a multitude of other films , and that the splendid idea that opened the picture was about to be destroyed by contrivance and implausibility .the moral of the story centers around whether you believe one's self-sacrifice for the good of the world is a genuine and necessary one , or that unfilled desires are the height of all deceits .these and other interesting questions could have been delved into , if the plot wasn't so ludicrous , and if the film wasn't so uninspired , as to make it almost unbearable to stomach .	0
dumont shot this film almost like a straight documentary , using lots of close-ups on the youngsters , with long stretches of nothing much happening on the screen , cinema verite style , except the annoying sound of motorbikes racing through town , as it traces the life and lives of a troubled bunch of youngsters , with nothing to do but ride their bikes , play chicken with passing cars , hurl racist slurs , and pay no heed to what is happening in the world , as they cannot fit into society , and are angry at their state of being .it is a film where nothing happens , but boredom is rampant , where a sentence of dialogue makes us pick up our ears , as if something is being said that must be heard and we don't want to miss it .it was more fit to be a primer for the ills of society put under the microscope , and how aimless a young man can be , and uncommunicative , that he so easily loses the one person who could have held him in check .	0
in this kidpic , which is a very safe movie to make in today's iran , as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead , and a more liberal regime in its place , there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story , because of strict censorship , and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in , is in a type of film like this one , where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system , as everything is seen through the children's eyes .the father is seen as a true believer , never questioning authority , deeming everything to be in the hands of god , whereas his religious beliefs are so strong , he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the mosque to have for his tea .but as an impactful film , it falls on its face with a thud , unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children , where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine : rich people are not bad they can be nice , schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating , religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary , being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world , and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding .	0
this very ordinary story is related in soap opera style , evoking heart tugging sympathy for the victim .this film just couldn't move me with this familiar storyline ; its purpose was to try and get me so misty eyed for these two nice people who can't find romance together .i guess this is ok , because you really can't root against them , and the way this film was slowly moving along , with lots of wasted artistic shots of the small-town that had no impact on the story ; at least , it satisfied an audience who would appreciate seeing such a clean-cut and prosaic romance .	0
it is taken from a paper thin story by the renown pulp writer of the vox populi , john grisham ( the screenplay is credited to al hayes , but rumored to have been re-written by robert altman ) .there was , as far as i could tell , no particular character development of the principal players , no intense drama taking place , no new insights into the judicial system , or compassion felt for any one remotely connected with this story .the film becomes an actor's studio venture , with the following characters acting out their supporting roles with varying degrees of effectiveness : clyde pell ( robert downey jr . )	0
it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news .as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen .there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star .	0
all the vignettes involving the violin changing hands in different countries made me cringe with embarrassment , as the tales were so devoid of any logic and so ridden with cliches , as to make them unintentionally laughable .that the film has lost all track of itself in these tedious vignettes , so much so that it has no chance of ever uncovering what it probably wanted to show , of how the universal message of music brings harmony to the world and how it transcends all cultures and kinds of people .for some unfathomable reason , we are supposed to get worked up about a bidding war for the violin and who would possess this perfect instrument when for the entire film there was not one person in the movie covered in enough depth that we could get emotionally involved with , and to care at this late date about who owns this material object , when it has long since been viewed as a mere trophy , just doesn't make sense .	0
one thing becomes apparent , wenders has very little feel for comedy , all his efforts to evoke buster keaton type comedic skits fall flat .the film rambles pointlessly on-- and when he catches up with bauchau , these scenes of dialogue get pretentious , as if they were trying to say something heavy about images and the making of movies , but are really saying very little .the great portugese filmmaker manoel de oliveira makes a cameo to deliver a sermon on films , asking , " what use is the universe ? "	0
for three quarters of the film , an exciting , somewhat plausible thriller takes place , that is even occasionally intriguing .as a result , this film wastes splendid acting jobs by clint , ed , and scott .the script calls for no bold statements about the politics of the white house , which makes the film rather weak in scope and purpose .	0
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup .as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose .it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god .	0
celebrity is like an amalgam of old woody allen materials , which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot .woody makes a stronger statement in the film's subplot that deals with love , as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck .for starters , none of the main characters were cast right , and especially branaugh : there's no way , no matter how exact his mimicry of woody is , that he can be thought of as a neurotic , nebbish , nyc jew .	0
joseph ruben ( sleeping with the enemy/the stepfather/gorp/the good son ) has directed a lot of films that are just plain awful , as you could see from those mentioned above , except for the adequately made swte .the director spoon feeds the answer that he thinks the audience wants , and it all seems to be a predictable formula driven film instead of one filled with a raw energy .in this case , from what i have seen of beth's direct confrontational approach , as difficult as it might be to say no , i think most people in tony's shoes would have no choice but refuse her request .	0
so i looked at passion , a film about his love of politics , art , and filmmaking with a slightly jaundiced eye , and i was not disappointed .i still don't like his style , or his rejection of a linear story for a rambling dialogue that misses more often than it hits the mark .i admittedly find some of his premises provoking , which is why this film , has enough intellectual stimulation in it for me not to loathe it , just to feel unsatisfied by all its unfulfilled promise .	0
a second-rate , watchable noir film , distinguished by its gritty authentic nyc location shots and the lack of acting ability exhibited by this largely unknown cast and the low-level crime committed , where the detective jokes that this crime didn't even make it into " the daily news . "he doesn't seem like he is an actor or a cop , but he does appear as if he is a genuinely nice person , which in the long run might prove better for humanity , but it doesn't help this film , a film that could have used something more from him to spark this ordinary tv-like crime drama .spotted by our hero , he shoots it out with him unsuccessfully among the many gravestones , which makes for a colorful scene , the best and most memorable one of the film .	0
also the murder plot is just not that funny , and when it becomes more involved , it just becomes a sick joke that goes on for too long ; and , the film ends with a one-too many helicopter scene that couldn't be more ridiculous .in other words , the film moved along at a fast pace , there wasn't much to think about , and might be just the thing for those who would consider this a date movie and not be concerned that it didn't deliver a heavier meal .in this case , since i wasn't stuck on the road , my excuse for eating this junk food was that i was enticed to try something new they were advertising on the menu , but after tasting it , i felt it was just like the same old stuff they always serve in those places , and i just wasn't hungry enough to appreciate that .	0
it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection .there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this " cute " idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society .the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in .	0
om puri ( in custody/city of joy/target ) is an accomplished actor from india , whose trademark face and ability to be very expressive and exuberant , engages the film with his sense of what it is to be a decent person .but the filmmaker doesn't even attempt to play fair , the story is told totally from his point of view , all the others around him are one-dimensional characters , who are not only uninteresting but they are for the most part made to appear annoying .but the worst thing about this film , is that it is a snoozer , not able to make its story about the virtues of being faithful to your culture and your wife come to life , as it is mired down in one clich ?	0
as a nervous accountant from dyson's firm , the one who will hand over the ransom money to the kidnapers goes through the phone drill of where to drop the money off , the cops follow along and have some forced conversations on the way to stir up some humor in this poorly characterized and acted script , that will rely on trick plots and a series of betrayals to tell its very forgetable story .one of the cop conversations mimics many of the more recent neo-noir genre films in slickness , as hawkins is reading jim thompson's crime novel " the killer inside me , " which he has already read and greatly admires , with the main thrust from that conversation being that the book says there is only one plot in a murder mystery and that nothing is what it seems .the characters ranged from being obnoxious to being miscast , though if one wished to , a case could be made that carla gugino exuded some charm and sex appeal into the film .	0
it worked reasonably well for part of the film , as dead bodies came popping up unexpectedly in this sleepy montana town , but then the story ran out of tricks and everything about the film fell apart and the psychopathic woman hating slasher , lester long ( vaughn ) , became a tiresome charge , his maniacal charm just wore out his welcome on screen , and the film's conclusion lacked tension or purpose and seemed to be a wasted effort , as it just simply ran out of gas after about an hour into it .clay is somewhat of an innocent , at least , as far as the murders go , but he certainly can't be commended for being a truthful person .everything gets resolved in the film's anticlimax , that mercifully ends in an arrest , though some 30 minutes too late , as far as i'm concerned .	0
larry buchanan has created this cheapie aip color film that has a great title , a dismal story and hammy acting worthy of an amateur thespian production .it's the kind of film played out in a serious manner , that you couldn't help either enjoying or hating it for its awkwardness and how bad it was .what goes for special effects , are scenes where women are disappearing and aliens are appearing out of thin air .	0
the story quickly makes its point , as valid as it might be in orwell's novel , here it seems trivial , that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldn't be doing , when they would be much happier being accepted into the middle-class where they duly belong .the message i got , as i watched this tepid middle-brow , so-called art film , is that living in poverty can be stifling , and that kind of life is not what makes an artist .if one looked hard enough , there can be found some wit in gordon's portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary .	0
the story was so confusing , that the film could have been seen in any of the following ways : as a typical teen dating flick , a sci-fi movie , or a comedy spoof of the horror genre .cahn raises no serious questions about anything- he seems to have a money and brain outage when he made this one .this film was originally released on a double bill with " i was a teenage werewolf . "	0
cahn's four skulls is a rather humorless and flat horror story , but it's blessed with a wonderful title .challenging idea was never really followed through , as the film instead became a conventional melodrama .but in the hands of someone more intellectually capable than cahn , there was the thread of a good story available , instead of shooting for the mundane , the reliance on the creepiness of the killer and the spectacle of seeing a head shrunk to tell the story .	0
there is a level of flatness to the film , as it is not aided by its feeble dialogue and uninteresting special effects , its incredulous tale , and unexciting tone .but all seems gloomy , because if they can't be stopped here , they will surely go on and attack the mainland .this film should be liked most by fans of either christopher lee or peter cushing , who will most likely appreciate lee's stylized performance .	0
the spanish director , bigas luna ( jamon , jamon/golden balls/the tit and the moon ) , known to make very unconventional and sexually implicit films , has apparently toned down his act here , shooting for satire as his only proverbial fish in the barrel to shoot at .not only did i find this film a bore , the acting uninspiring , and the motif unconvincing , but what annoyed me most , was that there was scene after scene of horty telling his inane story of his dying love for marie , to an audience that pays to hear this so they can have a good cry over it .the melodramatic soapy romantic story , just never sailed gracefully across the ocean .	0
it leaves one all fuzzy and cuddly inside , as the film uses risque material to make its point , yet it is almost totally devoid of hot sex .it traps you in its formula mode ; you can't help wishing these blokes do well .the film's popularity does not surprise me , people seem to like quick solutions to their problems and films where thinking is not a prerequisite for enjoying it .	0
the most profound line said by anyone in the film is said by edie falco : " things are not always what they seem- ben ! "the film yearns to be a story about how impossible it is to be free in today's world and how everything one does hurts .i had no feel for those in the film , therefore seeing the violence was much like reading a newspaper account of a tragedy occurring to strangers .	0
it's a one joke movie that quickly runs out of steam , as the cloying humor soon becomes insipid and the comic situation turns out to be more ridiculous than funny .it's a star vehicle effort , so if you like de niro and crystal , then you have a chance of falling for the film's silly premise and not caring how inane the dialogue is .the film is loaded with sight gags , clashes of culture between the educated jewish doctor and the tough-guy italians .	0
the stories he told about the english bringing fleas and the damp to ireland , didn't evoke the comedy or sympathy for him that it should have .the whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery and poverty , as the family will undergo a series of hardships , including the loss of three young children .the film has a bored look about it , indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross events and that frank , as a survivor , will somehow come through all this misery .	0
this play-within-a-film , much like bullets over broadway or shakespeare in love , but not up to both of those film's achievements , nevertheless it manages to develop a somewhat pleasing storyline and some amusing comic moments .the second memorable performer is umberto bevalaqua ( walken ) , the detested theater critic , who plays the part of a fop , excessively showing his outrageous mannerisms .aida turturro , the real-life cousin of the director , plays a part that makes good use of her huge breasts .	0
director risa bramon garcia , making her debut after a successful career as a casting director , seems to be more interested in getting the pop music of the 1980s heard and the bizarre dress of party goers viewed , than in telling a cohesive story .then i felt the party was really over and this mtv produced story faded out with not one interesting character in the film .i bet you a dollar to a donut , that you could have gone to most any other new year's eve party in manhattan and met more interesting people !	0
the shame of this film , is that it was oddly enough entertaining for long stretches , as it seemed to pass for being a diverting actioner , until it reached the point of no return in tolerability .john frankenheimer moves the action along at breakneck speed but the more the characters try explaining the ever-changing situations , the more ridiculous the explanations become .the thing this film mostly gave me , was a sense of astonishment that frankenheimer , who could still in flashes shoot a scene that is mesmerizing ( the one on the cracked ice with affleck jumping into the chilly water to save theron ) and then follow it up with one that is so dopey ( machine-gunning warfare in a casino that looks like a supermarket ) , that you wonder what happened to the director in a career that spanned 44- years .	0
there is no feeling for characters or intensity in this story , it looks contrived from the get-go .all the characters , except for reese's , are slime balls , people we could care less about .so when this film moves into its different plot twists and all kinds of ludicrous situations develop , it wanes in interest , as the characters were never developed and the film has a cheesy look to it .	0
a superficial b- movie about flying saucers , offering no relevant views on matters of space exploration , except some might be amused to see washington d .though , the exception to this uninteresting sci-fi film at the time , might be the one adapted from robert heinlein's novel " rocketship galileo , " which was made as " destination moon ( 50 ) . "the silliness of the film is delightfully highlighted by the finale of the flying saucer attack on washington dc .	0
flash back to modern times and a workman on an archeological dig unearths a jewel box and the mummified body of a faceless man .meanwhile the bronze medallion found in the jewel box is examined along with its inscription : " whoever stands between me and what's mine shall perish .this is enough to make that swell derby he wears , spin around atop his puzzled head .	0
swindle , the ( rien ne va plus ) ( director/writer : claude chabrol ; cinematographer : eduardo serra ; editor : monique fardoulis ; cast : isabelle huppert ( betty ) , michel serrault ( victor ) , francois cluzet ( maurice ) , jean-francois balmer ( monsieur k ) , jackie berroyer ( chatillon ) , 1997-france ) this is one of chabrol's poorer films , the fiftieth one for the 68-year-old french director .maurice is scheduled to bring the money to guadeloupe to be exchanged , and chabrol adroitly uses all his many years of filmmaking skills to show double-crosses and switches of bags , and how things can go violently wrong with even the best of schemes .the director seemed to try too hard to relive his past with many allusions to characters and inside jokes from his many films , with the old master pulling out his tricks of the trade from a hat with too much ease to be believable .	0
costa-gavras ( z/missing ) presents a film about the media exploiting the news and expects us to be surprised to find out that all they care about is the ratings .the amusing relationship between travolta and dustin captures our attention for most of the film , but nothing interesting happens .in the end , it is an old news story that we got-- but this time it is manipulated by the movie director instead of the anchor man and the new corporate executives .	0
the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job .his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras .it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling .	0
it is so much like those thrashy " b " films in the early 1950s i saw on a saturday matinee , where the theater was so noisy the elderly matrons who were the ushers looked like they were having conniptions , as they marched down the aisles with their flashlights shining on the children with loudmouths .those were the " good old days , " when you got to see two pictures like this for the price of one , and didn't give a hoot how raucous the theater crowd was , and how dumb and unbelievable the hero was .this film is a return to that dumbness , only this time its appeal is targeted for a more mature crowd and the price of the movie ticket has skyrocketed .	0
this film is tied together by four tired soap opera tales , that are competently-crafted but predictable .it is the usual tear-jerker fare seen on those afternoon soap operas on american tv .otherwise , this plays mostly as glorified soap opera , with few surprises in all of its lengthy presentation .	0
he exhibits signs of being a control freak , someone who might even be a nut case , by taking everything so literal and acting in a robotic and deliberate fashion when he speaks , so that everything he does seems out of place .it tries so hard to give itself a weird angle through its characterizations , which only work on a superficial level-from the neurotic damsel-in-peril , plummer- to the split personality performance of forster , whose actions waiver between maniacally calm reasoning to histrionic schmaltz , as he goes off the deep end reciting rhymes .if that was what he was thinking , he misjudged the quality of the film , but not before he showed flashes of talent here and there , for example , in the opening scene in the desert --- forster's calm demeanor was played-off beautifully against plummer's nervous energy , and with the desert lurking as a hostile backdrop to the action , it added a thrilling surreal sense of dramatics to the story .	0
her lips are of a succulent ruby red color , and when she pouts or a small smile comes over her , there is a very sensuous crease that comes over her mouth and chin area-- plus she has a nice laugh and cries in a dignified manner when she has to .what the film does well , is capture the nostalgia and musty atmosphere of a place where music geeks hang-out , memorizing tunes and reciting them back-and-forth to each other , as if they were idiot savants who overdosed on sugar .lisa bonet made up for her inconsequential part and gratuitous sex scene by adding a beautiful song to the film and a warm presence to a story that wasn't that hot to begin with .	0
but the way of telling the story by flashbacks within flashbacks , from the view of the male lovers who were deceived by the pert heroine , nancy blair ( laraine day ) , is visually unconventional , and the story itself , is cleverly diverting .as an added bit of melodramatics , blair cracked up over this and was institutionalized , and only recently was released .the plot devices were too leaden to be fully credible , but the complexities of the heroine's character were well presented .	0
thereby , the film is reduced to overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth between past and future events , sloppily changing one for the other , until nothing made sense , since you have to keep changing both simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish that storyline with accurate details .gregory hoblit ( primal fear/fallen ) has fallen into the trap of going overboard in his use of sentimentality , which overtakes the film and makes it too gooey for comfort .also , his directing suffers from an inability to tell a good detective story , even if his idea on time travel is intriguing .	0
it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation .the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop .it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw .	0
it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy antics noticed in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation .the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had too many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop .it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw .	0
a modern day comedy taking place in havana , cuba , that is laced with supernatural implications , as it is directed with artful flourishes by fernando perez .in the pulsating background , capturing the whimsical mood of those who live in havana , is the staccato music of bola de nieve and benny more .whatever pleaure there was in the film , came from its splendid ballet numbers , the beautiful artistic framing of its shots , and its bouncy music .	0
the last 20 minutes of the film offers a surprise twist to the story and thereby saves it somewhat from the doldrums it was in .it results in a film that gets its message across that freedom is frozen in china , that things are still far from democratic .it was a though-provoking film , but in a very manipulative way , that was none too pleasing to view despite its good intentions .	0
this girls' sitcom film is strictly fluff , with a few comical moments succeeding in a long line of misfires .the girls try so hard to be funny by making faces and doing slapstick , that it is a shame that the storytelling ability of the director is so poor , that it undermines the comedy .whatever that means , it was the funniest moment in a film that couldn't get to central park if it was standing on it .	0
this is basically a harmless ww11 war film that is watchable for insomniacs turning the tv dials late at night in search of something benign .this is one of those films that has a simple plot and pads it with supposedly human interest stories , as it highlights one character from among the officers and one from the enlisted men .the film's purpose was to build tension for its action-packed climax , but by having an inferior complex because of the thinness of the story and the characters all being dullards , an effort was made instead to show how courageous the captain was and how he was , predictably , able to win the men over to his side .	0
except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed .cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one .woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain .	0
a promising near-future , sci-fi adventure film , whose leaden direction , weak acting , and incredibly inadequate set designs , cause the good premise to collapse into an apocalyptic failure by the time the film was resolved .this film should have been entertaining , but instead felt tiresome .there was no fun to be had , no noteworthy dramatics , dialogue , or story developed .	0
gregg araki ( the living end/totally f * * * ed up ) professes in the opening credits that this is a movie about heterosexuals , as opposed to his other films about queers .the parody seems so cold and distant , and it comes from lowlifes who have peanuts for brains , which makes their attempts at black comedy seem futile .after seeing all the mayhem , absorbing the teens in action , watching how retarded and alienated they are , the film felt as healthy as a diet of fast-food , crystal meth ( speed ) , and shotguns .	0
" gun shy " puts in a lot of effort to be zanier than the other mobster comedy films it takes the same theme as , except here it is a lawman instead of a hood who is suffering from anxiety attacks and is in need of seeing a shrink .the usually bland liam neeson had more of a flare for this type of farce than i thought he would have and platt , in his inimical style , got off a few good one-liners , such as " fun is overrated . "sandra bullock , whose acting career is spinning ever-downward , had a small role that only required she look good in that oversized shirt she likes to always wear .	0
it is stiffly directed by philip haas ( angels and insects/the music of chance ) , whose wife belinda wrote the screenplay and was the film's editor .this is a token of her patrician generosity , as she figures , this guy's a refugee running away from the nazis , i might as well give him something wonderful to remember for the rest of his life , so if he goes back to the concentration camp he , at least , will have some pleasant memories .to inject some comedy into this dull film , derek jacobi has a small part as a drag queen , offering mary his support .	0
what it fails to do is tell a coherent story , as everything about this exaggerated tale is hopelessly lost in a sea of silliness .there was an attempt to show that besides speaking the same language and looking alike , the two feuding ethnic groups have a lot in common .8 million dollars and shot in 35 days , is rife with rapid cuts and scenes that seem disjointed and unconnected , it just seems like an incomplete movie , and one that rubbed me the wrong way with its pat messages .	0
it is a poorly done remake of " them ! ",	0
lily tomlin is the american in the group , a bold lesbian archeologist , in a role that is inconsequential , she doesn't even have any funny lines , but she's always smiling , dressed in pants , and sunburned ( the reason for her being so happy , is that she is probably daydreaming about some of the better films she has been in ) .she has the most embarrassing line in the film , as she explains to luca why she remains in italy , " i have warmed both hands before the fires of michelangelo and botticelli . "this was a ridiculous movie ; it was an apathetic sudser with flat dialogue , stiff characterizations , and if it didn't take place in florence , where art is a way of life , this film would be a feckless fiasco .	0
though some adults might look back to those halcyon school days with an anxious leer and wish to recapture some pubescent memories of some shameful incident and to feel the nostalgia again through this movie .but it smartly restrained itself and never pushed the envelope that step too far , staying well within the framework of how traditional sitcom comedy works .the film sells itself through its sex scenes and then after exploiting every awkward sexual moment it possibly can from the teens , it reverses itself with a contrived moral ending to say that love is not forced and comes naturally , while those only interested in sex are creating unnecessary problems for themselves and putting undue pressure on themselves to be happy .	0
the screenplay was written by dorothy azner , who made it into a statement film about women being abused in a male-dominated society .it therefore doesn't surprise me , that , perhaps , gabrielle wasn't as nice a person as portrayed in the film .this film is worth a look only for historical reasons , to see how melodrama was done before there were talkies .	0
they haven't seen each other for some time , so i guess granny has a memory lapse of what she thinks of him , as for some inexplicable reason she helps get this romance started .at one point in their romance , ryder when in central park , waxes poetic and tells him , " i can smell the rain . "she then coos and makes a contorted face of pleasure , and with this trite dialogue and mushy call for love , amid the autumn splendor of the golden leaves beautifully photographed by changwei gu , we are asked to believe that these unreal lovers are for real .	0
a showtime original movie that results in a very strained comedy/mystery story , one that is more stupid than offbeat and less noir than in the mode of a sophomoric film school work .she can do no wrong , no matter how rotten this made-for-tv film is or how ridiculous her part is , as she sticks out like a rose in a weed garden , plying her talents as a sex-craved psychic for the police .the wonder view apartments has a swimming pool that is polluted with slime and filled with debris and it has an assortment of odd and annoying tenants , from wise guy roller skaters to corny lovebirds .	0
another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line .it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin .there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded .	0
there is some nasty action , lots of bad guy mafia men talking tough to good small town people kind of stuff , but the film was too dry to be anything but mediocre .	0
michael dinner's geezer mobster comedy has a funny premise but falters on the execution part , as the yuks come , but not often enough to sustain the predictability and staleness about the film .the director had a barrage of proven comic material to work with , an able cast ( except for burt reynolds-he was terribly miscast ) , yet the film falls flat on its face .i also left the theater by way of the rear door , and i also had a look of consternation on my face , wondering how easy it would have been to make this a much better film with just a little better effort in working the script .	0
before the film looses its grip on its subject matter and becomes too contrived and lightweight , as the opposing parties wind up on the same side -- it had some sparkling scenes with the hippie conversing with the stone-faced fbi man .at this point the film breaks down into the absurd and the comedy comes in dribbles instead of gushes , as the running gag over mistaken identity comes to a brutal end .by this time i was forgetting how much i enjoyed hopper's manic but egotistical performance and wanted the film to end before it lost all its appeal for those who were hippies back then .	0
a mild thriller that has the glossy atmospheric look of a riveting horror film but not the impactful story to pull off this foolish sadistic killer tale in a reasonable manner , which results in one of the stupidest endings imaginable .it is a film that is done in the genre's formula mold , laying on all those mindless gory contrivances that horror fans have seen before , it is also a tale that has more holes in it than a new york city junkie .its appeal might be that it is so absurd , so lacking in tension and quality filmmaking , that one might be lulled into its state of languor and accept it for what it is : another horror movie in a long line of such films that should be a staple at the drive-in or as a movie rental for insomniacs who choose not to rent porno to get their cheap thrills .	0
a poorly done documentary that is superficially entertaining , whose blurred camerawork , its failure to get hold of its subject in anything but a self-promoting manner , and its campy playing with the criminal scandals and lawsuits that became front-page news fraught with sex charges and fraud in fund-raising is done in a witless manner , which leaves me scratching my worldly head about why this farcical film was made or why it thinks this would make tammy faye , the subject of the film , look better than the national joke she is .but it failed to get me to see her in any other light than that of a self-absorbed publicity hound and someone who is superficial to the point of being a caricature of someone who is superficial , though if she is compared to those other christian hypocrites -- like her ex-husband jim bakker , jerry falwell , and pat robinson , she passes the likability test with flying colors .i didn't buy into her act and i didn't find the film funny , when it should have been both a scream and a much more informative piece than what was presented .	0
the thin story never moves far away from its sophomoric attempt to shock and irritate a white male audience about its simplistic findings , but something that is certainly thought of in a very real way and taken to be a serious generalization by western society .figure , with the main stud taking on every positive sexual myth of his prowess that he could about how good in bed the negro is .this is film that fell in love with its generalizations and can't go further than that , even failing to draw comic relief from its stupid characterizations or making the protagonist anything but obnoxious and terribly vain .	0
it's possible for peter greeaway ( " drowning by numbers " / " a zed and two noughts " /``prospero's books'' ) to make a more boring sexual/erotic fantasy film , one that is more didactic and analytical , but not likely that he could duplicate one that is also so full of itself as this one was .it is the director's audacious opinion that he can get away without having a story to go with the full frontal nudity display of men and women he flaunts throughout the film .it results in a torturous viewing experience , as pablum is spouted in verbose spurts of emotive stagy responses , while the reward for the viewer is a few stilted visual delights and a few restrained chuckles to be had at the absurdity of all the perversity .	0
however , " bedazzled " is a remake of a more vulgar source for the faust legend , stanley donen's 1967 very funny satire , which starred ( and was written by ) peter cook and dudley moore .she has a sweet smile and shows she can display a nifty tantrum , but compared to hurley's beauty and wit , she comes off second best in both categories and would not have been my first wish .all seven wishes are played out as comedy sketches , with some being terrible , filled with stereotype gags and dull-witted humor , such as the one where he becomes the witty author who is well-equipped but learns that he is gay ; some of them do have some spark , like the dumb giant n .	0
this is a pointless b- film actioner , a remake of the gritty 1971 british noir classic directed by mike hodges , which had the good fortune to have michael caine be the star and to have a story with an edge to it .this " get carter " features mindless violence , an incoherent and uninvolving story , and most unfortunately the humorless presence of the miscast stallone as a vegas mob enforcer , going to seattle for the funeral of his bartender brother he hasn't seen for a long time .he tries to give the film a moment of acting , hugging his niece in a warm embrace , as behind her back he grimaces with obvious pain on his teary face , assuring the audience to pay little attention to this human gesture , they shouldn't worry , he hasn't gone soft , there's going to be a payback .	0
this parody of other gangster films suffers from a bad case of mindless imitation and hapless comedy that might be funny to someone in japan , but does not have a universal appeal .it tries to take dramatic situations that occurred in those films and apply them out of context here , by poking fun at the hit man's mystique .the film's conclusion is a mixture of madcap comedy and an attempt to give meaning to all the lives of the dreamers who befriended sawaki .	0
if there is anything amusing about this film , which is doubtful , it comes at awkward moments for the two convicts , who are trapped into being perceived as homosexuals .and to make things fit the formula pattern of this very soft satire , chappy and harry start dating .if this were on tv , where it belongs as a sitcom , there would be canned laughter during the mock romantic scenes .	0
the answer lies in the shekels found in the box office over the years , as this trite story line , the romance between opposites and the cute obstacles layed before them , seems to draw its fateful audience ever since hollywood was a hill that filmmakers put up a lettered sign on .screenwriter richard curtis' dull workmanlike script seems to have the knack in getting to hugh grant's screen presence , the one that brings the paying audience in , as he previously did for him in " four weddings and a funeral , " but can't go further than that .the comedy unfolds as we watch how gracious the self-absorbed roberts is to the plebians , even confessing to them about her perpetual diet and that she's a bad actress making $15 million a picture , and we also see how nice and whacky the ordinary brits are , fawning over the american screenstar .	0
a rather mild comedy/mystery , filmed in b&w , featuring the bumbling comic antics of jack lemon and the ravishing beauty of kim novak .under richard quine's laborious direction , the film plods along until it perks up for its surprising ending , which is a takeoff on those slapstick silent comedies .i found the production too dry and hardly on par with those buster keaton vehicles it tried to emulate and the mystery story was too lame-brain an effort to cause any fuss over .	0
this drawn-out tragic love story manages to get at the characters it highlights , though what it uncovers is more obvious than startling or insightful .it was a thoroughly uncomfortable but poignant scene , shot in mostly brown and yellow coloring .this film reminded me of a thomas hardy type of novel that was written by someone who didn't have the writer's obvious talents and has come up with a story that mostly captures the stark atmosphere of the rural community but does not put a proper perspective on the psychology of the characters .	0
this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice .jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson .if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch " mad dog morgan " ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner .	0
the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were .on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast .i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade .	0
it's a thriller stressing supernatural shocks and fuzzy apocalypse dramatizations , that has the cast trying hard to be convincing about all the hokum presented of bloody rivers in nicaragua , dead fish in haiti as the sea boils , of birds falling from the sky , the earth shaking , ice in the israeli desert in the same place as sodom , and hailstones on fairfax ave .the film lacked a decent script , meaningful acting , and credible direction .the film's moral message that the world can be saved with hope , seemed like mush .	0
a poorly made thriller , reeking from conventionality and lacking real suspense .in conventional films like this one , someone who rails against the common man's lack of art knowledge , deserves to be cast as the villain .that location scene is all i enjoyed about this rather trivial and commercially made suspense film .	0
the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects .it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future .the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement , and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents , who do not trust each other .	0
it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing .the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work .the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to .	0
this is a poorly directed and scripted derivative casino heist movie , shamelessly stealing jokes , plot situations and shootout scenarios from many other such films , including " ocean's 11 , " " honeymoon in vegas , " " the limey , " and " reindeer games . "the only lame joke that made me laugh , was when one gang member asked , what's the advantage of dating a homeless woman ?this film is so ridiculous , that as one of the cynical fbi men wisecracks , after learning about murphy's rap sheet , " you can't make stuff like this up . "	0
the gimmicky premise grabs your attention , but the film fails to maintain its suspense as the story line becomes increasingly more absurd .this unnotable suspense yarn , brings little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which was more silly than tense .director john badham ( " saturday night fever''/ " stakeout'' ) tells the story effectively in real time , which makes it a watchable though forgettable film .	0
it meant well , showing the charismatic abby in the best possible light as the '60s prankster symbol of anarchistic , ecstatic , anti-establishment revolution , but this clich ?the film , adapted from two books -- abbie and anita hoffman's " to america with love : letters from the underground " and marty jezer's " abbie hoffman : american rebel , " was two goody-goody in its approach to capture either the mood of the changing times or the manic-depressive mood swings of the unabashed publicity hound , who thought of himself as a hippie organizer .d'onofrio who is a big man does not physically resemble the much smaller hoffman and his odd boston accent sounded artificial .	0
this film , a roger corman exploitation b-film , is a relic of the 1960s and its only value might be in helping sociologists discover what went wrong with that era's visions of universal love .bruce dern acts as a guru for fonda's initiation into lsd , telling him " i'm gonna be here , man , trust me . "it offers a false sense of nostalgia for those who were into acid , and for others , they should get a good laugh at the expense of someone else's unintentionally bad film .	0
this is also shown to be the prevailing opinion of every other coal miner in town--that it's something only for the lassies to do .this was the most energetic scene in the film and the only one that kept me fully awake , as the kid convinced me he could dance with pep .	0
it's an old-fashioned type of film , that has the main characters talking in phony polish accents and throwing out schmaltzy dialogue at will , as it suffers so much from being poorly scripted .there must have been a reason why neophyte director/writer theresa connelly made this film into a nostalgia story that wants to look like it was made in the 1950s , i just wish she included that reason as part of the storytelling and dropped all those clich ?in the realm of movies that try so hard to please its audience , this one almost begs for audience approval , but the only thing that should please the crowd is the sex appeal of the beautiful looking ensemble cast .	0
a film that could have been an interesting study about a cold-blooded hit man , but instead ends up without much to say that isn't banal .lee pogostin is a weak one , as is his original screenplay , as is his flat way of directing .the film belabors its point about how violence is killing the world and preaches to a snoozing audience how love can soften even the coldest of individuals .	0
it's a manipulative film and if you go with the flow of the story and accept the logic presented , then everything is manufactured to make you eschew reason and be persuaded by your blind emotional responses .these are diversionary tactics that can easily lull one into just going into a slumber and accepting this contrived film at face value without giving it a further thought .the widow of saint-pierre is juliette binoche ( in my book , she's the julia roberts of french movies , matching the american in superficial acting techniques ) .	0
the ensemble cast is made up of many stars in cameo roles , but that does not guarantee that the acting is good .the film is a series of sight gags , nasty one-liners , pronouncements against the church , and awkward comic scenes .it is directed with reckless abandon by alfonso arau ( like water for chocolate/a walk in the clouds ) , with a disarming heavy-handedness and lack of subtlety ( it ends by this in-your-face statement : god is sending a message , if you can't take a joke , go f * ck yourself ) .	0
in imitation of pulp fiction , there's lots of frivolous talk .harry is a good guy with an honorable code of ethics and would be fine , if his gambling habit didn't make him so twisted .the film has nothing to say that makes sense , the acting was forgettable , the dialogue was trite , and all the characters seemed to be out to lunch .	0
open secret is a quality story , but is a cheaply produced b-film with similar themes about anti-semitism as " crossfire " and " gentleman's agreement . "this is one of the rare occasions that leonard played a cop instead of a gangster .the story should hold your interest .	0
this invasion was the heart of the film and lasted for about 40 minutes ; it got its money's worth in good airplane battle footage from the computer-generated imagery ( though the scene itself had a flatness that made it appear uninvolving but competenly done ; there was no emotional resonance to any of the action ; it was respected for its technical achievement rather than for being artistic ) .the trite dialogue , inept script , misuse of history , irritating character portrayals , the soapy background music , and the clanky acting by everyone concerned , made this overlong work into a critical bomb .it reduced everything to the lowest commom denominator by the crass bruckheimer rules for commercial success ( keep the dialogue banal and down to the film's theme , and keep everything in motion so no ideas could get in the way of the mindless violence on the screen ; this way it remains on a fourth grade level and can be easily understood by the masses ) .	0
in quills he has adapted doug wright's play to create a drab period piece of the marquis de sade story .in this version , the marquis de sade is made out to be more of a misguided writer and a witty aristocrat than truly a murderous villain .this was a middlebrow work , that made light of the innovative marquis as a man who was merely politically incorrect rather than completely debased .	0
you'll need some kind of a pill to sit through this soap opera piece of dreck .i can't see a fan of hollywood films ignoring an infamous classic pic like this one forever .it is interesting to note , that all the men the girls become associated with are either : gay , sick , cheats , mean to them , or just plain wimps .	0
this is a tense hostage-gangster film set in the 1940s , so the hoods wear fedoras and business suits .his bleeding-heart liberal attitude is not thought of much at present but in this film it seems to be the voice of reason , as if criminal behavior can be explained away by a bad environment and by getting counseling when in trouble .it's all pop psychology , but the actors are so serious about it that it's amusing to hear them say their lines with a straight face .	0
former hal hartley actress adrienne shelly directs her second feature , a low budget indie about a blind date gone bad .bernice talks a mile a minute and the disinterested sad sack bill finally gets a word in and nastily tells her " you're ordinary and pathetic . "i found this scene to be particularly dull and wondered why it was so scripted that bernice had to be told her granny had a lover by max and wouldn't have already have known about it , that is if she was such a caring grandchild as the film wanted her to be portrayed as .	0
there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging .it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues .the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground .	0
the film is filled with violence , vulgar dialogue , and seems devoid of real feelings .it relies on twists in the plot to keep you tuned into the investigation and shocking scenes to keep you aghast at the horrors of being in vietnam .the acting was flat , the story was trite , and the suspense was marginal .	0
an old-fashioned " jock " flick , notwithstanding that all the basketball players are white and the game seemed played in slo-mo .this one plays as a moralistic tale about the temptations placed before young athletes , and how the hook goes into them making them succumb to fix games .it was second-rate as far as acting and the story line had the stench of a locker room smell all over its reels .	0
i would have chosen vivaldi , but barry white songs are played throughout , thereafter , and in my opinion were the most lively thing about this film .the film is set in lyon , where we are told there is a large unemployment problem and because of that men seek pleasure from prostitutes more than they do in good times .blier just didn't take this story anywhere , even the elegant charms of the very ladylike whore , grinberg , soon loses its appeal .	0
it was a drawn out glossy affair stuffed with empty gestures to the arts , and i could never figure out what john turturro was trying to do with his role as the chess genius , who is both a social misfit and someone who is mentally unstable , except to ham it up by acting over-the-edge .there just never seemed to be any point or excitement to this film , as adapted by screenwriter peter berry from vladimir nabokov's ironic novel .these flashbacks were an attempt at making crass amateur psychological explanations for luzhin's emotional unstability due to his wretched upbringing .	0
this sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography , as it was filmed in the australian outback , and for its innovative editing cuts .no actor was provided with a challenging part , but diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate this action story .the characters ranged from a shrill radha to a cartoonlike diesel , making it easy to root for the aliens to possibly , against all formula film odds , pick off all the survivors of the spacecraft .	0
this was not a very satisfying thriller : it lacked conviction , memorable performances , and intelligent dialogue .an example of the film's inane dialogue can best be heard in a typical conversation between the two protagonists .there weren't many layers to peel away from this story before discovering how manipulative it was , how it was without a strong actor's presence , and how it failed to make a strong psychological imprint ; the characters were made into objects of a contrived tale causing the film to lag .	0
this is fluff romantic/comedy that has many holes in the story ; this makes the film lacking in certain basic standards of filmmaking .it's also reflective of the 1920s male chauvinistic attitude toward women , where it can be said with a straight face by one of the main lady characters : " that a man wants beauty not brains in a woman . "the clinging vine is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination , but it does present an historical perspective of those silent era times .	0
a ponderous melodrama that even becomes more awkward by the film's end .the doctor prescribes for her a powerful pain-killing pill that is fatal if more than one is taken within an hour .	0
the film was shot almost a year before " almost famous " made kate hudson into a celebrity , and a golden globe winner and oscar nominee for best supporting actress .he's a bullshit artist extraordinaire , with an easy manner about him , who cunningly knows how to reach out to women , which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but after that became annoying .but my gut reaction is , i had a belly full of this guy long before the film ended and therefore found this vacuous story unsatisfying .	0
the hitmen quickly locate all of them since the gang fails to cover-up their identities properly , and the film becomes a vehicle for showy performances .the only memories from this film are of the gruesome kind , as killing is the thing here and director ishii--who used to illustrate manga--hyperrealistic , action-packed japanese comics--goes all the way with this theme by making it into a cartoonlike story .tarantino's reservoir dogs looks like a shakespearian classic compared to this b-film , one that hopes to get by with its all-star cast and the menacing performance by the indomitable takeshi " beat " kitano .	0
it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed .a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ?here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout .	0
the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book " the shovel and the loom , " goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received .	0
the film ends in mystery , as it is not certain if ehrlich and elsa escaped or were killed .it was a tedious chase and an irrelevant story , and the dialogue was just atrocious .this letterboxed version was watchable only to see how lana acts while wearing furs , evening dresses , and tight sweaters aboard the freighter .	0
the video version i saw was badly dubbed in english and showed tunisian subtitles .chabrol is having some fun spoofing the conventions of magic and the rationality of science , and how the idle rich have nothing to do in this world but make trouble .the story was slight , the suspense was not earth shattering , and it resulted in film that hardly mattered .	0
a sophomoric action comedy with a distinctive australian flavor , relying on screw ups to provide the comic situations .should appeal to teenagers and to those who think like them , and for those who just like a madcap film and don't concern themselves with plot and character development .it's much like ritchie's " lock , stock and two smoking barrels , " as its humor is of the physical kind equally mixing a crime caper story with dumb or , if you prefer , black comedy .	0
ladd speaks in a laconic monotone voice , while jones is shrill and unappealing .it over sentimentalized the children and made the adults into wooden caricatures of evil .ladd seemed miscast , while jones failed to be convincing in her role .	0
also , the story was much too confusing , with too many characters appearing in uninteresting or unexplainable roles .there was hardly any mystery to this tale , as it barely met the minimum formula requirements for a chan episode .marcel is plain annoying , he's not funny , and he overacts nonstop .	0
this b-film , directed by samuel fuller , is one that failed to work .the setup seemed so wooden , while the bourgeois villains seemed more like cartoon figures than real people .even the hero and the heroine failed to be convincing and looked more like imitations picked off the reels of other such b-films .	0
the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie .the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax .it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper .	0
soul survivors , written and directed by steve carpenter , the writer of blue streak and the upcoming ocean's eleven remake , is a by-the-numbers horror movie whose only real scare comes from the sudden blast of a starter's pistol at a swim meet .even the ending explanation leaves plenty of plot holes to ponder .carpenter tosses in a few erotic scenes , but ones that are in no danger of threatening his film's pg-13 rating .	0
it's a story about outsiders who use violence to get what they want , as all the characters are severely dysfunctional and act goofy to make sure we know how screwed-up they are at all times .i don't see what's the big revelation about that , since i don't know of any sane person who doesn't realize that killing someone is a pretty serious thing .what it caught was a sleazy and exploitive look at a teen-age wasteland , and added nothing relevant to our understanding of such empty lives .	0
the premise of this thriller might be good , but even a great director like fritz lang and a superb cast consisting of joan bennett and michael redgrave can't save this film from its sophomoric use of freud to give the film's conclusion a pat psychological response to a serious mental disorder presented .but he evokes as much suspense as you can out of such nonsense , and the visual images by the great cinematographer stanley cortez are truly remarkable .but even lang himself thought this was a poor film , and he'll get no argument from me on that score .	0
it was shot semidocumentary style , with a sober voiceover telling of the growing juvenile delinquency problem in the film's beginning and ending on the note that it's up to the family , school , church groups .the film might be of mild interest to those who desire to see how suburban white teens socialized , dated , had fights , and dealt with their parents back in the 1950s .the film didn't even have good music to go with its teen story , and that includes julia lee singing her rendition of " dirty rock boogie . "	0
otherwise the film is largely a bore , saddled with endless speeches from the main characters and an outdated paranoic viewpoint .it also suffers from a ludicrous ending on the steps of the lincoln memorial , where the commie racketeers get their just desserts in a ridiculously contrived setting .but it looks good in black and white photography , and all the actors are so earnest in their roles that it makes one pause before raining on their parade .	0
this low-budget , inane , cheesy , message sci-fier was of such poor quality that it was laughable and entertaining in a way goofy films sometimes can be .the clunky message of the film ( the way the film presents it is clunky ) , is that all the world's nations should be working for peace and not getting into the nuclear arms race .highly recommended for those who understand that a film doesn't have to be good to be enjoyable .	0
it results in a film that distances itself from the audience , as there's not one character worth caring about .but dorothy is as nutty as a fruit cake , so he sticks with june .the most interesting thing about this flick , was the cinematography of john alton .	0
the film has a plot , but it is plodding and hardly seems up to being a b-movie of director roger corman's usual medium standards for such low-budget works .if that wasn't a silly enough premise and wasn't filled with so many holes in the story you could build a mountain on it , there's more hokum .there's not much to this film except for the moody scenes it sometimes creates and the gothic atmosphere conjured up ( a spooky castle with boris karloff sitting by a fireplace while attired in a regal bathrobe ) .	0
d alcoholic and despondent detective as its star , a predictable and uninvolving formula serial killer story , and plot devices that are unbelievable .it doesn't make sense at present , but by the time this predictable story winds down it becomes evident why he was given the case over more capable detectives .it's all very forgettable stuff , as the actors are going through the motions of acting and this lame script fails to develop anything interesting to say about the psychic policeman .	0
a lighthearted comedy farce built around a crime caper , but is mostly built around the star power of paul newman .the film misfires because of its weak script , lack of punch to its comedy , and the plot was too incredible to believe or become absorbed in .the story itself is disappointing , but this is the kind of sexy and amoral role that fiorentino is very good at .	0
d hero and the formulaic story never caught my fancy , no matter how much the director tried to make things happen .there were just no surprises forthcoming , as the film seemed to be marking time until it shows him as a leader and proves himself heroic .the director must receive credit for at least getting together a good cast , though i would have loved to see this one with a ed wood jr .	0
it's a romantic comedy that spins every formulaic device possible into overdrive to come up with its cutesy love story , missing only the presence of julia roberts and any sort of genuine passion .it plays as if it was an ad showing how the 'beautiful people' spend some quality time doing the nyc scene by taking in the waldorf astoria , bloomingdales , central park's wollman rink , and when looking up toward the skies they can even spot nyc's tallest skyscaper--the empire state building .house before a fireplace and a bunch of burning candles placed on stands at different heights in a setting that looks like it's an ad for furnishings placed in a bloomie's catalogue .	0
as the friendship grows between the boy and the stranger , we are forced to hear such banal profundities from the pen of king uttered through the lips of hopkins as : " sometimes when you're young , you have moments of such happiness , you think you're living in someplace magical , like atlantis must have been . "the film's all about a contrived atmospheric mood it sets in mystery to lead you to believe something is going on , as it hopes your imagination will be better than the author's in finishing the story .everyone seemed like a cardboard character waiting for either the " low men " to emerge or for another trite golden nugget of wisdom to fall from the lips of hopkins .	0
i thought of him robbing houses in a miner's helmet , being a smooth cat burglar , as merely clever filmmaking , capturing what is sort of odd to watch , as this fat guy bounces around and is so agile .sometimes just being ordinary , hides so much more about a person , and voight seemed to have heavy things on his mind , that might have been more interesting than following this dead-end , obvious tale .what i got was a masterful performance , that i can't deny , from gleeson , and a director who can be magnificent in setting a playful confrontational tone with what he had to work with and letting the camera do its job .	0
though , i gladly admit , i enjoyed viewing the unusual road scenes in the desolate brazilian countryside , where the people are poor , ignorant , superstitious , and craving for a religion that gives them some form of hope for their dismal lives .this former documentary film director , ably showed how religion can be as phony as the government that keeps most of the people impoverished .therefore , for me , the strongest point of the film is the documentary type of cinematography that went into the parched brazilian countryside , making the barren land throb with life .	0
the book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments , is the one by the italian chemist and former concentration survivor , primo levi , whose autobiographical , " i survived auschwitz , " shows what it really was like in those camps .though the italian jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp , because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering , nevertheless , it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead .amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes , which probably never go out of style , since the audience where i watched the film , howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits , leaving me to wonder why i can't muster a laugh .	0
the movie is very loosely adapted from soren kierkegaard's early treatise on beauty , infatuation and the power of intellectual persuasion .but the explicit sex is kept to the minimum ; instead , it uses the need to find romance as a form of irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness .but for a film about a book a great philosopher wrote , not to be thoughtful , is in my humble opinion , only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a philistine way .	0
films backed by big money like this one , rarely ever go after controversy , much preferring to steer a trouble-free course , with a clever eye to the bottom line .what was ultimately unforeseen , was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs , which the ship rammed into at full speed .by the way , i saw a night to remember ( 1958 ) , and thought that version of the titanic to be just grand , not cluttered with a trivial story , just sticking to the suspense of the historical event , which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards .	0
after a brilliant , stylish opening sequence , this film begins to unravel and by the time it ends , it is a misfire .assassination taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done , and well worth the price of admission , as de palma goes crazy with his cameras offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the casino .we soon learn who the villains are , so the picture that so brilliantly set - up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as : loyalty , corruption , sense of duty , patriotism , and one's own personal dilemmas begins to go off in another direction , in the direction of where the film - makers think it can draw in the box office crowds , that is , it turns into a flat action movie , where things are easily predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the characters .	0
this version of browning's poem is well-told and sensible , and probably a lot like he meant it to be conveyed , but somehow it looks flat on screen , like it was a b movie , and this is surprising , since demy is really a great director .but , evidently , something went terribly wrong here .the film is so flatly done , it was as if i was watching the machine-like actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling story , that when it came out on screen had lost its chills , even if the story itself remained chilling .	0
this film has both the look of a daytime tv soaper and a cheapie movie .i can't begin to explain why he does that , unless he is so arrogant and bored with life that he feels he has to do it .chabrol has made a career out of being vague in his films , and more often than not it has worked to his benefit , but not this time .	0
at other times , the film drifts off into soapy sentimental territory , becoming contrived and not sure if it wants to be that honest and truthful about the bitter-sweet story it is telling .it is a movie made by ealing , a british studio , that actually used mostly a british cast , making the film seem more british than aussie .it is a film that disney could have easily made ; and , it should be noted that this film was made into a successful television sitcom .	0
he is self-serving , he presents here a bitter picture about romance , but he mainly pokes fun at either himself or his fictionalized-self , going through his wide range of jokebook material on jewish neurotics , that is sometimes devilishly funny , sometimes as flat as matzoh , and sometimes done in just plain bad taste .but when i have given up all hope for this muddled mish-mash to amount to anything worthwhile , the " putz " gets off some acidly perceptive comments that go straight to the laugh belly .so what's the big deal if the story is not so hot , and woody is a selfish-lout , don't kvetch , enjoy yourself , you don't have to be a nihilist to get a few yuks from this film .	0
there was something emotionally flat and unconvincing about this story , that not only rubbed me the wrong way , but made me think how apologetic the filmmaker was to the real events of history , as he tried to force feed the audience into believing so many untruths about what actually took place , that it is hard for me to say that this film made up for its distorted history lessons with its pleasing music and cabaret-like mood its splendid cinematography presented .its call for the world to be less nationalistic and more global minded , had a pleasing ring to it , but that is simply not enough to counter how tame the film appears as a whole , as the story does not dig deep enough into the real events ; and , also , the characters are only superficially dealt with , despite the terrific performances , so that the love story and all the different personality clashes seem to be glossed over , not making me feel involved with them as much as i should be .leaving me with the impression that i was seeing a good looking and sounding film , but one that did not ultimately satisfy my need to feel that germany has learned its lesson from its most pernicious period of history , as it fails to answer the question , how can such a cultured people accept the atrocities of the nazis so willingly .	0
another film skewed for tarantino enthusiasts , and this one is just as conversationally maddening , filled with vulgarities and street talk , but no sex .this is done while the boys are playing poker , and it passes for about as much wisdom as you are going to take away from this well-acted , dark comedy/suspense film , that is absolutely ridiculous , but it is entertaining as escapist-fare .there is one more priceless pearl of wisdom dished out , that i feel should be mentioned , because it highlights the confusing messages the film sends out , it was also uttered by charlie during his confinement , and for no particular reason it made me laugh aloud-- " everybody lies : but word on the street , that's solid . "	0
the strength of this symbolical film , is in the way the director pavel chukhrai , is able to explicitly show the harshness of the stalin years as it infected the daily life of its citizens .the the weakness of the film , is that it is really not drama , but soap opera , that is convincingly done through the powerful persona that mashkov , a russian stage actor and romantic star of cinema , is able to evoke from his strong performance , who is cruel and capable of being loved at the same time .the story is just too pat to be that effective , except as a curious look at what the russians themselves thought of stalin and how they functioned under his regime during the '50s .	0
an effort was made to provide a crisp dialogue , as mamet , was supposedly the richard weisz , who is mentioned in the credits as the story writer .what gives it a lift and a sense of being something more than the thin story it really is , is the beautiful camera work and moody colors of the cinematography ; and , the superb acting by a very capable cast .i admired his manchurian candidate ( 62 ) and french connection 11 ( 75 ) for the raw power of their stories and their keen insights into his characters' behavior .	0
film brings out a collection of philosophers to state its case ; such as , sartre , kierkegaard , nietzsche , and heidegger .this thinking man's vampire movie , is a natural for the midnight cult audience , but will seem out of place in a prime time slot .if you want to see a film that is more credible than this one , that handles the same subject , but injects more life and fear into its story , and less philosophy and guilt-ridden religious themes , check out larry fessenden's habit .	0
an inanely delightful and slickly done and predictable escapist film , based on an actual hostage situation in st .it didn't stoop to gratuitous violence and seemed to be trying to say something about the proper procedures to follow in a hostage situation .gary gray , who seems to make light of the fact that danny had to take hostages to prove his point .	0
since the film will not offer its opinion about what to do with this not so nice or redeemable idler , but chooses to show its fairness by unfairly attacking both sides of the abortion argument .everyone in the film is stereotyped : the pro-lifers are republicans , religious fanatics , family value people , sexually repressed , drivers of station wagons , and self-righteous .it's weak position on the issues allowed it to throw stones at everyone and seem like it was hip to what was going on , but in reality it changed no one's mind about abortion ; and , in the bargain , it wasn't a particularly funny film .	0
instead of character development , we got rolls in the mud to convey the deep feelings of how the young lovers felt about the confusion puck's love potions had on them .but the director made a lot of odd choices in this film that take away somewhat from the magical feeling of the play and make it seem artificial , or more of a commercial venture than it should be .also , the flatness and clumsiness of the fairyland scenes when juxtaposed against the lively actor's troupe , made this film seem uneven , even begging us to utter with conviction the bard's choice words : " what fools these mortals be . "	0
she explains henri's dour disposition and lack of ambition away , with the ridiculous comment that she knew he would amount to nothing because he was a late walker .instead , what happened was that this drama went on cruise control , with a functional dialogue and characters who really did seem to resemble each other after awhile .the film's bleakness was somewhat lessened when we see the bookish denis and the outspoken betty riding off together on a motor scooter , hopefully to live together happily ever after .	0
if you can suspend critical judgment regarding the thinness of the story and the robotic acting and taut dialogue that should have been made funnier instead of playing it so straight , then you should be in a receptive mood for what the 1950s took for schlock cyberspace .we are in the prime time of hardened cold war attitudes , which are bristling with military solutions and a case of good old paranoia to keep us on our toes .in this cheapie production , he makes the most of the sets he created , and in the final battle scenes between the army and the martians , they look good enough to add a certain amount of necessary chills to the film .	0
all the characters are busy pursuing their goals to succeed in the image-oriented fashion industry or in the cheesy video and tv soap opera markets of new york .this was especially amusing because joe had to betray all his lofty views just to get this vulgar job , before losing it because he mouths off to an ignorant assistant director .but all the film added up to , was an easy to watch , slick nyc life-style satirical story about those trying to make it in the glamor business , told by an interesting director who tried to say something more than what was actually said .	0
the coca-cola signs and the luxurious hotels serve only as reminders that this country is being overtaken by commercialism and greed , nevertheless the director seems content to film his picturesque view of the city , as is , of these materialistic intrusions appearing without any kind of analysis as to why .everything gets tidied up in nice little packages by the film's end and every one walks away enchanted , and this very picturesque take on saigon , that seems to be a love affair the director is having with his ancestral country , turns out to be an irksome charmer to behold .it was mostly an arty kind of mush , fed to a western audience that is dying to see something nice about vietnam , even if that something can't get past being sentimental jive .	0
a typical 1950s noir , distinguished by its rapid pace and taut script , that delves mainly into the character of the villain-- making him out to be someone who went over-the-edge when he couldn't take being ridiculed as a failure , anymore .by being nearly blind and wearing thick glasses for his myopia , he assumes the role of a victim in society , visually manifesting a pathos based on this physical handicap .this the suburban atmosphere and the no nonsense style of telling the story , are a stark contrast to the suspense building up for the very characteristic 1950s couple .	0
castle also effectively features in homicidal a lot of copycat things from other films , such as the psychotic mannerisms of the killer , which was lifted straight out of psycho .homicidal is a classical horror film , but featuring mediocre acting and plot ; its one gigantic plus is the interesting characterization by jean arless , who seems to be swimming in a different stream than the rest of the cast .if you are in the proper humor for a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously , you have nothing to lose by seeing it , which is the attitude the bellboy had when he mumbled just those sentiments to himself before accepting the bizarre marriage proposal offered him by the seemingly attractive blonde .	0
this social comedy is a slick sick one , told in short sketches , where absurdity and perversity go hand-in-hand with the dress , which is the subject of the film .but by making it just an object , giving it no other symbolic significance , the film has to rely on its biting satiric humor to carry it through .this bawdy comedy , should guarantee it some audience abroad , though those seeing it in the netherlands , have an added plus going for them , as they should be more able to recognize the cameos that some of the notable dutch film stars make in it .	0
all this spy business was rather vaguely done , and gave no particular credence to the story , except it did show a large vacuousness among the young as to their country's recent history .the naive hero is not convincing enough in his role as a seeker of justice and the film as a political thriller suffers from a lack of focused direction .it was a good idea for a film , that tried to show that metaphorically opposites might attract but can't stay together , but it was too poorly executed for one to sustain an interest in its long drawn out meandering story .	0
this original youth film , that has the look of a pseudo-documentary but is a work of fiction , with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing mid-scene from reading a script to doing ad-libs , fails to answer the simple questions i put to it about what it is trying to accomplish .what saves this film from being a complete absurdity , is the raw energy exhibited by the director , as he is on the cutting edge of cinema verite , showing the pent-up hostility and alienation these trashy young people have .two skin head teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride .	0
a most improbable but engaging romantic mystery that holds our attention and teases our sensibilities .the storyline is awkward , melodramatic and incredulous , and the ending is somewhat ludicrous and overplayed , but what becomes interesting is the psychological games played by the couple .the basque director/writer has created a story with enough twists in it to keep you guessing at what will happen next , but the film left me with a bitter-sweet reaction to the romance .	0
all-in-all , a pretty disgusting lot , which makes this film a tough watch , with not enough elasticity to its story than to be more than a coming-of-age film that ultimately brings up the wrong lesson in life to learn : that it is sometimes better to conform than to rebel .the film itself lacked any sustaining energy to show that it really cared about the enemy it was fighting .it looked like it was too in love with the evil elite being depicted and invested too much in their presence to properly distance themselves from them and tell the story of the resistance fighter , like it needed to be told .	0
this fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of its working class neighborhood completely , and by being grounded with this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective .kevin bacon plays the role convincingly , with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension , coming close but never going over the top , like a lesser actor might have been tempted to do .i just had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift , and that even though they were hard working and nice people , they were not a very perceptive couple .	0
the history part seemed to be accurate enough , depicting the corruption of the king's court and his placement of more importance on vacuous wit than genuine ideas .he thinks ponceludon might have some chance of succeeding in being witty and offers him lessons of how to survive in versailles , such as , " don't laugh at your own jokes and never laugh with your mouth open " , " call puns the death of wit " ; and remember , " the soul of wit is to know one's place . "but mostly , it is a predictable french farce , with enough one-dimensional characters in it to fill the court of versailles with retorts that would pale next to those heard in an average schoolyard in urban america on a daily basis .	0
alan ( trouble in mind , choose me , moderns ) rudolph's off-beat film has the look and feel of bad melodrama , using over-exaggerated action sequences to spin a convoluted yarn ( maybe a parody ) about twins , born to a ballerina who had an affair with a european aristocrat and is forced into giving them up for adoption when he wants no part of her .as all the quirky characters will somehow fit into the story and by the end of the film , i guess , there is supposed to be some hidden message as henry stands alone , looking down at the tremendous depths of the grand canyon .petosa gives us from his vaudeville shtick he seemed to be doing for his characterization , " if money didn't grow on trees , how come banks have so many branches ? "	0
we watch him begin to unravel , and you are perhaps feeling like i do at this point of the story , that i am being set-up , following a tale that is so unbelievable , that i am being taken for a sucker to buy into this .so when i saw what actually developed , i could only think of how clever this filmmaker is , that he used the same formula that someone making toothpaste commercials might use to catch the consumer's attention .the director is a graduate from the video and advertising world , well able to work in that slick media market , who has come up with a novel idea for a film but one that falls short in being credible .	0
the acting was convincing , but the story didn't have enough suspense in it to sustain interest , especially when the ending was becoming increasingly predictable , as the story wore on .what interested me in a rather oblique way , was how tired life in poland seemed , and how the real enemy seemed to be the bureaucratic nature of the country , that was off-handedly touched upon in the scenes at work , as the love triangle waned in my interest .i thought of how different things were in america during that time frame of the '70s , and how similar bureaucracies seem to be wherever they exist , whatever the time frame is .	0
it made me wonder why wenders seemed to be so concerned in the first place with the socio-political manifestations of a top-secret government project gone awry and the public being exploited by hollywood ; and then , he concentrated for most of the film on the usual crime stuff of murder and missing persons , basically ignoring what he tried so hard to bring to center stage .most interesting and diverting scenes in this part of the film concern the poetry performance readings that some of the movie folks attend .this results in a film that has a few good ideas but goes astray , leaving it with a disjointed look , that is artistically satisfying to watch but empty of meaningful inquiry .	0
it succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for those who like to see brad pitt' pecs and how edward norton squirms when beaten up , and be bemused to hear helena bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex .it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film , which makes the provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life , which are given to them by false prophets , something that is happening currently in america to a great extent .their alienation from society , supposedly , relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems , which should give the film a conventional reason for being made .	0
as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this , it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls , and it does so , by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it .this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste ; but , it is , nevertheless , faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation , and what the heck , they seem to be ok people , and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight .i think the major fault for the film's dullness lies with the co-stars ; i couldn't get aroused by holly hunter's performance , as intelligent as it was , it was still too plain and too staid .	0
this b-movie , made in b/w , is a cheapie from american-international pictures , and is good for a few laughs and a few shakes of the head .the special effects were fine , the quasi documentary atmosphere it presented helped give it the look of a cold war era film ; the movie was seriously done but nevertheless it was hilarious .for all its failings and ridiculous dialogue i , nevertheless , enjoyed watching this 80 minutes of hokum .	0
benedict heinrich , head of a fascist government ) - are in a horror film that shows little affinity for the genre and apart from a few scares , this is a rather tepid effort put forth by the director .these are the quirky characteristics found throughout the film that makes its humor rather odd and might appeal to certain fans of this genre .the film ends with a cryptic warning by fremont that all is not over with yet .	0
the remainder of the film flounders in long stretches of unbelievable fantasy , some soothing touches of originality here and there , oodles of romantic schmaltz , and a story that can't hold up to intelligent scrutiny .but , then again , if you bought into the film's gimmicky filmmaking style and didn't think it was a smarty-arty pretentious ploy like i did , then maybe you can have a better feel for how the story transpired than i did .there is so much wrong with this film , that even when things are going well for it and it seems like there's some suspense and an intriguing bit of artiness thrown into the script , inevitably it is ruined by a story that just doesn't make sense , and even if it did make sense to those who are more tolerant of the film than i was , it still doesn't excuse the filmmaker from trying to be too clever and disguising his story as something it isn't .	0
it is just too bad that tab is such a vanilla actor and natalie is earnest but unconvincing in her role as a half-breed .the only actor with some life to him was skip homeier , but he was too much of a caricature of evil for his character to be anything but cardboard-like manic .what was out place about this film , was that despite the beautiful photography and gripping action scenes , the story covered no new ground , though it had its opportunities , but it failed to take advantage of them .	0
a hurricane warning is issued , but because of the poor radio equipment they have , which was not properly repaired by willy , the message is cut off and they don't know how serious that storm will be .but willy's most fatal mistake was to purchase fire extinguishers that were cheap , but would comply in appearance with the air safety codes .the film's ending is routine formula fare , with a few " predictable " surprises of heroism and villainy , the kind of middling story churned out regularly by the studios who lack the imagination to delve into anything but superficial waters .	0
a 'b' movie political thriller , that was shrewd enough to get newsreel footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of parliament into its closing action scenes .the weak script and uninspiring dialogue , is compensated for by the crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story .the revengeful hennessy has a one-track mind , never revealing anything about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with such a ludicrous scheme , as the one he has hatched .	0
the film should be like a meditation , as the introspective primo wants to get it out of his system what it meant to be a jewish prisoner and how it was unbearable to come out of that camp and think that you could still be human .unfortunately , the rest of the film , as worthy an effort as it is , about a subject matter that merits to be told again and again , as its holocaust tale can't be told enough to the world for its message to sink in and should be told in a multitude of ways ; nevertheless , as compelling as the film was at times , it also shot itself in the foot by trying to tell a conventional story while the more powerful and personal tale of primo levi was somewhat sacrificed by these very typical hollywood episodic scenes of how the other characters reacted to their liberation and with rosi's added attempt to attain some comic relief from these diverse characters being poorly accomplished .i just couldn't help feeling that this earnest attempt at capturing the mood of that horrific event , lacked whatever it takes to make this a first-rate film .	0
he is dressed in a black mask-and- cape , which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences .the film is not much on character study , instead it's filled with action sequences and a melodramatic love story between zorro , who hides his true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher don alejandro ( de gray ) , and the sweet lolita pukido ( marguerite ) .the story itself was a cliche , featuring his cardboard-typed father wanting his son not to be an idler and make something of himself , while the son feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate , performing silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible senorita his father fixed him up with .	0
a b- film psychological thriller from the 1942 novel by stefan zweig that runs out of thrills eventually and ends on a flat note ; but , for a while , it had its exhilarating moments of suspense .the acting by everyone but jurgens was horrid .the story made no great impression on me but it was curious to watch how someone can handle isolation by concentrating on the intricacies of a game he doesn't really understand .	0
war effort in korea and offering a scathing commentary on counterfeiters , comparing them to saboteurs , as the film states the most powerful weapon in america's arsenal against communism- is money , turns out to be basically a promotional movie for the work that the treasury department agents do .in this film , he never brings about any tension or real shock to the story , as he did in his first noir work .it is played in the same sobering tone , with no room for comedy or any quirkiness to the vanilla story unfolding .	0
the film seems like a museum piece , about a time that existed long ago but strangely enough , probably , still exists .the story is told in a dry , matter-of-fact style , with the b&w photography adding a gritty feel to the secretive work environment and the snow-capped streets of ottawa .this picture had the look of something that was important , but it didn't have more to say than what any reasonable person could already assume about the soviet union .	0
for a film that runs close to 70- minutes , is in b&w , and is short on storyline , this b-film does a nice job in getting a hugh cast to be part of this crime caper , each getting into the act with a brief moment of quality movie time .the falcon's brother is a routine espionage story , that is crisply told in a manner that is formularised and executed to perfection .reason they were so popular , is because they're so easy to watch and the stars exude a certain amount of charm , making these little crime capers quite enjoyable .	0
bosnian-born writer/director emir kusturica ( time of the gypsies , underground ) has come up with a robust ( lively music and characters with plenty of energy ) but excessive screwball comedy with felliniesque touches here and there , and before the film literally goes in the shit , it was able to show some warm romantic moments and garner many laughs from its odd-looking and strangely-acting characters .the group of gypsies were mostly nonprofessional actors , colorful characters , with their mouths filled with gold teeth , and a screen presence that was absurd and defying in logic .it takes suspension of belief on the part of the viewer to stick with this one for its complete romp across gypsy land , plus the skits become too labored to sustain the frenetic pace of the film .	0
its rise in critical evaluation over the years , where it was once reviewed as a typical war movie but now because of siegal's rising star as a director , has been granted " cult status , " which resulted in receiving much higher praise than i think it deserves .what siegel did for this b&w film , along with ww11 expert robert pirosh , was tighten up the script , make it more suspenseful , and emphasized the psychological differences between the few men of the 2nd squad and the pyschopathological attitude of the mcqueen character .after the men spot this , newhart goes into a telephone routine he used as a stand-up comedian , but only here it is not funny and seems out of place .	0
there's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir film , one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a smallpox outbreak in the new york city of 1947 .it is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of america's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything foreign , as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken by something unknown attacking it .the action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told , while the noir characterizations of sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject , but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it .	0
though not a complete failure , preminger's american version still managed to take most of the starch out of this bitter french chiller and make it seem dull and predictable .the film opens by painting onscreen hollywood's idea of what a small-town looks and feels like , as the sun is shining , the mailman is cheerful and nosy , and everything about the town looks picture-perfect .but laurent takes a more cautionary approach saying , " you can't dismiss these letters completely , they are written by a psychopath , and they have been known to act against their own interest . "	0
this tolerable but not particularly interesting noir film suffers from a meaningless story , lacklustre direction , and even though , it has a good cast , the two glamorous stars , robert taylor and ava gardner , seem miscast : they are too beautiful for their parts .there was no conviction felt in the two stars succumbing to their pangs of love ; they brought little to the story in the way of true cynical noir feeling , and it is only the heavies , vincent price and charles laughton , who keep the film hopping with their stock villainous portrayals .the film , badly compromised by the romantic directions it headed in , was unable to pick up steam , until the finale , where there is a splendid shootout between taylor and price amidst a fireworks display .	0
this stylish work , filmed in all the sleekness of a modern madrid inhabited by the affluent young , tells its jarring tale in a non-linear way , sure to confuse even the most avid moviegoer .i felt it tried to be interesting , and touched on many different genres , from romance to sci-fi , to tell its kafkaesque denouement , but it was not particularly a moving experience .i felt uninvolved , finding myself easily drifting into my own dreamworld , and as diverting , beautifully acted and photographed , and entertaining as the film was , i thought it was mostly about style and not ideas .	0
therefore it never works on the intellect , instead it attacks the emotions and cheapens its efforts by pretending to delve into cage's angst .the results are as gratituous as any found in a myriad of cheap adventure films that appeal to a ready made audience , not looking for a thinking picture .the box office mistake of this film , is that it took itself seriously , somehow believing itself a thinking picture , and thereby lost both types of audiences .	0
a sophisticated mid-victorian drama , told in the form of an allegory , about upper class society , playing more like a pbs special or a high-brow merchant-ivory film but with a darker secret to tell .it comments on the environment influencing one's behavior more than anything else , as the female protagonist is studying a colony of red ants attacking black ones .the film was visually pleasing ; the costumes were beautiful ; the script was acceptably literate , and the film ably took the viewer into an antiquated world and its peculiar customs , where the many maids who worked at the estate turned their back to the wall in the presence of their betters , giving one some rough idea about life there .	0
the film was mildly diverting , suffering from a weak storyline and trevor howard as the lead actor .what was gritty about the film , was the quick-cut editing , the magnificent black and white photography , and the keen direction .the film had a certain amount of distress coming forth from it characters and lots of brutal scenes , adding much suspense to the routine story .	0
what can i say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots , was driven by a fantastic performance by bruce willis as a contract killer , but was disturbingly vulgar ( the murder of an undercover cop is used as part of the comedy routine ) , except to say that it was driven by characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other .these demented zany characters , not one of them who was without a blemished soul ( reminiscent of pulp fiction and analyze this ) , is a popular reworking of the gangster film into comedy , a phenomena of recent times worth taking note of in the gangster genre .this is lighweight entertainment and should work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script , questionable values , and that there are no nice people in the film .	0
tim robbins and joan cusack play the smiling but sinister couple until it becomes nerve-wracking to watch them try and pull this nonsense pose off , any further .the film is resolved in an incredulous fashion , as if it were trying to evoke a cry of sympathy ( ala oklahoma city ) for a tragedy that seemed acted out for symbolic purposes rather than portraying real people made up of flesh and blood .if you leave aside the unconvincing acting , the implausible story , its inane political views , then you might find this film somewhat entertaining and it may raise for you some pertinent questions about the fbi's handling of recent bombings .	0
brian de palma's idea of a thriller is short-changed as far as plot and substance in favor of style .he has created a silly but entertaining film , where one shocking scene tops another , and numerous hollywood cheesy gimmicks are used instead of relying on john farris' tightly drawn suspense story .tis a pity such crass commercialization should rule the day for de palma , instead of artistic integrity !	0
it questions the military leader's decision not to even fire a shot , though outmanned and sure to be defeated , but offering no resistance or support to their countrymen .the film ably depicts the peaceful nature of the norwegian people and how they found war to be a very difficult position for them to be in , and how confused everyone was at the time , as there was a lack of leadership from the top .the last lieutenant doesn't have anything new to say , but what it says about one's loyalty to country and how its military leaders were faced with difficult decisions , was deftly handled by first-time director hans petter moland .	0
it takes too much of a suspension of reality to believe in this outlandish plot : the devil is in our heads and was placed there by ordinary contact with others ( it spreads like germs do ) , even though it is played with zeal and candor by denzel washington , who is the squeaky-clean super detective john hobbes .the film worked only on a superficial level , as light entertainment and should be given credit for , at least , attempting to have a literate script .milano , who conveniently happens to be a professor of theology , tells hobbes , " if you value your life , if there's even one human being you care about , walk away from this case . "	0
the film is done almost documentary-like , and it almost seems believable , as the actors are all straightfaced about what is happening .i've seen a lot of sci-fi films that didn't make as much sense as this one does .but it was bearable and it didn't try to sensationalize the monster's killing spree , and if you are not too fussy about the flat dialogue and the phony mexican accents heard , one might even find this film to be easy to take on a rainy saturday afternoon .	0
but not satisfied with that , the audience is treated to three other electric chair executions and watching all the dull routines the guards go through in their daily work schedule .he is viewed as someone who has been granted a divine gift , but is still afraid of the dark , is illiterate and defers to whites as expected , reinforcing the vile stereotypes for the negro of that era .he is viewed as someone who has been granted a divine gift , but is still afraid of the dark , is illiterate and defers to whites as expected , reinforcing the vile stereotypes for the negro of that era .	0
but for those who are believers in the orthodox , needing some proof that god can hear their prays , then this serious-minded film with its lack of kitsch , supposedly , can shed some light how a saint is chosen and how miracles are documented by the church .it results in a draw between the rivals within the church structure , and who feels satisified walking away from an event and not having a winner !it was difficult to believe in the story or be absorbed in it , as the acting was stilted and the process of choosing a saint did not enlighten me as to what really happens in the church back rooms .	0
an old-fashioned ww11 submarine movie made for men , featuring an all-male cast , played with a square jawed military call for patriotism .if you get your sea legs under you and don't mind the film's history being blurred and its insistence on making heroes out of the men at all costs , then you should find it viscerally challenging and not be underwhelmed by its clich ?it is directed with emphasis on sustaining suspense , building on the action scenes , and letting go full force with its special effects , making for a solid and exciting effort .	0
a " b " movie , based on a british tv serial called the trollenberg terror , that is not to be taken seriously while it provides enough unintentional funny material and hokem to possibly get a mute to laugh aloud .please refrain from yodeling any uncalled for responses , upon learning that these outer space creatures have invaded switzerland , having just come from the andes .when brett is cut after attacking anne he doesn't bleed , but he folds up like a cheap suit when allen puts a few slugs in his belly .	0
i had an empty feeling seeing this film from its dripping blood onset , which was really the drippings from a raspberry sauce being poured over a fancy poultry dish , to its ambiguous ending ( where it is suggested that all the killings are in the psycho's head ) , and by the time the trick finale comes about , my empty feeling is just as prevalent as when i was bombarded by all the lists of toiletries the psycho prefers , his fancy squid ravioli with lemongrass sauce and arugula caesar salads in those upscale restaurants , and all the butchery that took place during the course of telling this president reagan era fable about yuppie greed , a slight variation on wall street's- " greed is good message . "while the film tries desperately to catch something about the psycho that an audience could sympathize with besides his good looks , but what results is that he can't be put together to look like a real person .in one successful scene , that is an amusing satire on status among the corporate-types , his colleagues compare their business cards as to the texture of the paper and the quality of the printing .	0
it has a few gratuitous shots of janis joplin and big brother & the holding company plus the grateful dead , playing to a largely non-hippie audience .the film reminded me most of a general hospital sudser , with a few noted nicolas roeg cinematography tricks , pre-performance , thrown in to give it a deeper look than the picture merited , such as jump cuts , time frame changes back and forth and forward , leaving one with a disjointed feeling about when events actually took place .the good thing about david's parents , is that the father is joseph cotten and it's always great to hear his uniquely rich voice on the screen .	0
this chilling tale left a lot to be desired and despite having an intelligence and originality to it , it degenerated into a jejune work , more of a display of style over substance .i felt cheated by its wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality , feeling more like i was being manipulated than i was at being treated to something special .the film managed to hold my interest until about the halfway point , when too much of the same interplay between dreams and reality was never made clear , so much so that i stopped suspending disbelief , which is tantamount to pulling the life support on one of these flicks and rendering it brain dead .	0
the other distinguished party in this revenge oater , is daniel b .ullman , a noted " b " western script specialist , whose unique stories were used in a multitude of westerns in that era .if you want to see a western , one like they don't make anymore , this is as good a representative as most .	0
a glossy mgm extravaganza of a bible film , more pleasing to watch for its conspicuous opulence than for its dramatics , dialogue , or politics .one of the shots i preferred , was of nero looking through a a piece of green glass at an orgy while poppaea looked at it through a red glass .peter ustinov's delightful over-the-top sissy performance was fun to watch .	0
he assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair and he also thinks , what could they do to me if i'm caught , i'm just a kid !the tense scene back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in most typical action films , but what makes this film a little bit different , is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear plants across america , even though this information is not widely known by the public .in fact , the acting was quite good in spots , especially , by christopher collet ; he convinced me he was a smart kid , while john lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart .	0
the film runs needlessly on for over two hours and takes this story into many different areas concerning religious faith , personal goals , cultures , comedy routines , and romance , with too many themes for it to adequately cover .the film stopped dead in its tracks when it took itself too seriously and a series of sermons were delivered about how ben stiller should resolve his love problem .the results are that the film is more awkward than controversial , more secular in spirit than religious , and it revisits grounds that are all too familiar and have been done far better by people like woody allen .	0
there are no surprises in this oater , but it's watchable fare .it is surprising how soothing these lightweight films can be and how nostalgic they are for those of us who sometimes have a yen to recall the 1950s , thinking fondly back when films such as this one were regularly part of a double-feature .but , by golly , you get to see the cavalry come riding in to save the day , and to me , that's when you know for darn sure that you are watching a genuine western .	0
the film is about his innocent autobiographical reflections , which are devoid of sentimentality and are emotially rich in seeing what influenced the child to be the kind of adult he became .the film , like the reading of poetry , demands concentration on its visualizations and allows for the free translation of what is seen , as no explanations follow .there is a warm place in the film reserved for the standard contemporary pop music of the times , with such songs as " i don't know why i love you like i do " and , " at sundown , " which is sung by doris day ; judy garland sings " over the bannister " ; and , " tammy " is sung by debbie reynolds . "	0
despite the film's coldness , lack of humor , bleak conceptions about relationships , unappetizing sexual scenes , lack of dramatic tension , and pretentious philosophizing by caroline ducey , it still had something disturbing to say about relationships that was worth listening to .to show this , breillat her heroine be nude for many scenes and therefore symbolically stripped her of all the illusions she has about sex , as we watch her act out these fantasies .the body of the film's works is quite different than its ending , which shows ducey giving birth to a son and her womanhood supposedly being fulfilled .	0
a more than adequate telling of the standard-type of 1950s hard-nosed war film , which is helped greatly by an outstanding cast .throughout the film , starting at its opening moments , the patriotic " halls of montezuma " song is rousingly played whenever there is a call for flagwaving .in " halls of montezuma , " milestone emphasizes the lives of the characters in the battle-tested 2nd marine company , rather than the battle scenes .	0
this routine noir feature just doesn't cut it -- it's story is too implausible and it lacks proper tension .what gives this opening scene its noir look , is the shadowy photography james wong howe provides in scott's escape through the window .the story simply didn't add up , but its quick pace helped move things along , and faye emerson and zachary scott can always be counted on to give competent performances .	0
an entertaining nonsense film from aip , directed by the master of the meaningless , edward l .there's some savagely inane dialogue , which should add a chuckle or two .and with dialogue like that and cheap looking props , as the film was obviously shot as cheaply as possible in the studio , there is no reason in the world to take this flick seriously .	0
he seems to have turned over a new leaf with this work experience -- as the film makes a concerted effort to show that work is good for you , that the bosses are benign , that the union can only succeed if it roots out the few commie operators in it who are trying to subvert its legitimate aims , that the communist party is the devil , and that you can't hide from your past mistakes -- so you better think about what you are doing before you sign up for a communist membership , because you can never get out of it once you join .the story was a lot of hokum and misinformation : it distorted the communist influence in the country and how big business and unions act .if you can somehow get by the polemics and the cheesy script and view this melodrama as typical hollywood , the film is quite entertaining , as it is shot in a dramatic noir style by musuraca and the leads all give able performances , swallowing some of the most tasteless lines ever with a great deal of bravado .	0
you get a few spine tingling moments out of the heroine's self-made misfortunes and a surprise twist in the ending , but you don't get a lasting sense that this isn't all manufactured tension to fit too neatly into its premise of how anyone can be a victim of a random act of violence and have their life put through the ringer .there didn't seem anything special about the acting and too many of the secondary characters were put in there as props to echo the director's point he was making of greed influencing corporate decisions .it didn't have the suspense of a hitchcock film , instead it had more the look of a second-rate movie made for tv , which could be entertaining for a late night audience that is not that demanding .	0
the film was hampered by a dull story and an uninteresting performance by shirley maclaine playing a nun hiding the fact that she's a prostitute .a typical eastwood cowboy scene , played in clint's graceful languid style , as he puffs on his cigar , quietly snarls , and does what the filmmaker hopes most in the audience would love to do in real-life .once inside , they machete the soldiers , make them into human torches , or just shoot them .	0
the comedy film relies on creative editing of the classics of the forties , somehow including a host of stars from bogart to cagney to ava , as part of its story .this is basically a one-idea film , and that idea , although cleverly worked out as far as special effects , begins to run dry after a while , as the story lags in character development .the overall effect is not bad for a few belly laughs and to marvel at the skills of 1980s technology , but no cuban cigar for the film , as the story went up in smoke somewhere over the hills of hollywood .	0
a routine aip action-packed ww11 drama of heroism .if you like a no-nonsense war story of all action , no big-name stars , and one that validates courage .you got it in this solid low-budget actioner .	0
a breezy , screwball comedy about police , with a slightly different twist , it is about nyc's bureau of missing persons .but this was a fun programmer , fast-paced and a typical warner bros .potboiler of that time period .	0
it's not believable that a hardened hitman would confess so easily , but he does .what this potboiler had going for it , was a nice look to its b&w shots of the dark streets of london , and through sydney tafler's melodramatic performance , it showed how a killer can be cold-blooded taking care of business and yet be a devoted family man and , though his love for his brother was genuine , it was still misguided .overall , the " b " film had good production values and a satisfying but improbable story to tell .	0
the film has its two eyes firmly set on the box office , its mind in the gutter , and a serviceable script for all its mayhem and profanity to have an urban gritty feel to it .the meeting of great minds , of the hateful wasp walter and the stereotyped lowlife peoples , who speaks a stream of constant trash-talk and with an enunciation that is so fantastically off kilter , that makes it fun to laugh at him .the comedy provided by wright's speech pattern is comparable to a cisco kid movie dialogue , if the two stars were on speed .	0
some might find this fast-moving play to be smart and witty .jacques villeret is an appealing fool , whose good-heart shines throughout the farce , even though he proves to be a true numbskull .there were a few laughs to be had , but this is really tv sitcom material and not great wit .	0
everything is so predictable about this glossy photographed film , everything is so banal , everything seems so dishonest , and the dialogue is so disparaging , that i found this to be such a morbid attempt at history , such a futile way to tell a story .only this film comes with some bogus history lesson thrown in , which makes it more shamefully exploitive , a " payback " with the redcoats as the gangsters .i had an ugly feeling when i left the theater , like someone was trying awfully hard to sell me on patriotism : using children , the flag , a horrid villain , all to shamelessly stir me up , instead of telling me a story about a credible character who got involved in the war for independence .	0
drew pearson's serious voice gives this film a documentary look ; and , when we see the gang in action , it is remindful of all those dead end kids' feature movies .all the gang members are stock characters and the predictable story sheds little insight about juvenile delinquency , offering only a square look into the grimness of street life .the only thing diverting about the film was some of the odd touches : the candystore lady insulting her customers while dispensing egg creams , and one of the dukes called crazy ( shelley ) , who is thinking about ordering ice cream mixed with french fries and potato salad , musing that it should taste good together , after all he likes all those foods separately .	0
a very familiar crime story , one that has been often done in recent times , about a rough irish neighborhood and the hoods who can't escape from it .the acting is good enough and the background music , a mixture of rap , rock , and celtic sounds , evokes a sense of irish doom .paddy's day parade to have its final shot--which is tantamount to waving the flag to indicate patriotism , or in this case , irish pride .	0
i'm just interested to see how fox's new comics-to-film adaptation presents itself , as i found very few such projects turn out to be worthwhile films .what seems tiring about it , is all the other characters in the film who are given quality time and end up just showing us their supernatural gifts and halloween-like costumes before disappearing from any further characterizations .i'm sure that regular fans of the comic book will find some inside jokes in the film to laugh at , but i just tended to grow weary of the effort and was not converted to the x-men project .	0
it is usually through dreams , drugs , one's creative work , psychoanalysis , or meditation that one looks back at their past , but bruce is too blocked for any of that .if one were to overlook all the impossibilities about this story and just concentrate on how the bruce willis character comes to resolve his problem , then the film is somewhat engaging .the movie was ably directed by jon turtletaub ( while you were sleeping/phenomenon ) and written by audrey wells ( the truth about cats and dogs ) .	0
a mindless psychological thriller set in vermont , that starts out in a promising mysterious fashion but ends badly , ruining any credibility it might have generated .zemeckis has built a story around a lady-in-peril , one with too much idle time , who is overwrought with a healthy dose of neurotic tension , talking herself into thinking she sees ghosts , but who doesn't know how to internalize that fright .michelle pfeiffer is asked to carry this film , but without an adequate script , even if she is a good casting decision for that role , her task is too difficult to accomplish .	0
it probably has more relevancy for its native audience ( at least , i hope it does ) , as most of its tv sitcom sketches just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna .it was a sweet , palpable , likable little domestic comedy , similar to what american audiences saw on tv in the 1950s and 1960s ( except for the nudity and frank sexual talk ) .carmen maura put on a good show , outwitting the episodic script and coming to terms with her great mid-life crisis in a pleasing manner .	0
what i didn't need was australian director/writer of " cedars , " scott hicks ( " shine " ) , to tell me what a bad thing the internment of japanese americans during world war ii was for a little over two hours of a darkly photographed film and then precede to bore me to death with a glum romantic/courtroom drama , that never got untracked , but seemed so proud of itself for being so politically correct in taking a stand against bias .the first part of the film , just stagnated , as uninvolving flashbacks filled the screen and uninteresting storytelling techniques prevailed , without fleshing out the reality of the characters except to see them in wooden terms .everything seemed so contrived , the film had no fresh air to breathe , the cinematography was darkly uninspiring , the courtroom seemed to be staged only as a reason to give the filmmaker his chance to applaud himself for being so free of bias .	0
matthew harrison's " kicked in the head " has its offbeat comical moments but in the end dies from self-indulgence and too much cuteness .the supporting characters were at least funny when they did their shticks in this rambling , derivative nyc movie , that tried too hard to be offbeat and in the process forgot it would be nice to have a story that made some sense to go with the film .but the film was too much of a childish fantasy on the part of corrigan , and the dialogue was too flip .	0
the problem with epics of this grand design , is they could never be dramatic enough and fall prey to episodic incidents to tell their story .the film was also bereft of any subtlety , its messages were of the kind that hit you over the head with a loud thud .but the point being made , in all the belabored efforts of the filmmaker , is that political regimes , materialism , and all causes are temporary , and that religions tend to be divisive .	0
a too obvious derivative supernatural thriller , most imitative of " rosemary's baby , " but without the same fresh intensity and without a credible script .rand ravich does a fine job directing his initial film , but fails miserbly with the storytelling part of his script .without a mystery to end on , the film becomes banal , having established no point of view and having nothing to say about space travel , it just becomes a predictable guessing game of how jillian will defend herself against her husband , someone who is really not her husband .	0
this film is all style and is non-judgmental in its observations , adding nothing more of subtance to the story than the inertia that is depicted .the film makes no comments about the conditions of a society that helped bring about such anti-social behavior and what circumstances kept the family incapicitated .this first feature by woods , based on a work that was presented on stage , had its powerful moments , making a strong case about how male insecurity and violence are so closely linked .	0
despite its limitations , this film is a curious curio , it is mostly interesting to watch clara bow , the " it " girl , a superstar from the silents make her entrance into talkies and have the longtime editor for paramount pictures , dorothy arzner , be given the opportunity to direct that studio's first talkie .this film can't be taken seriously , as its moral tone is questionable , its depiction of college life absurd , and its characterizations are all trivialized .but the film was snappy , a frivolous vehicle for the very appealing , good-time girl clara , who comes through with a heart of sweetness , while march shows he is more serious about the jungle than the university .	0
but hiruta is not reliable , as he explains himself , saying people used to take advantage of him and laugh at his weaknesses , so he now uses trickery on them and doesn't care about ethics .supposedly this film is a parody of the japanese willingness to accept america's foreign culture as theirs .here he has mifune and the concert singer become sexless , while the publisher becomes a stock cardboard villain , and the lawyer's fall and redemption are just too predictable to have any effect .	0
jacques tourneur should be credited for making this wartime propaganda piece into an acceptable action film , shunning politics for a typical hollywood wartime heroics and romance story .the film presented new and unknown actors , and only one of them , in his first motion picture , after appearing on the broadway stage , gregory peck , had any kind of star quality .this film was a ringing tribute to our wartime allies , the noble soviets .	0
this debut feature by the music video director joe charbanic is a limited venture , smacking of formula questions and answers to the serial killer's mental state , resulting in a picture that is decidedly painted by-the-numbers .james spader as the lead , most of his career a fine actor , has difficulty doing anything with his uninteresting and predictable role , except go with the props he's been handed .the film covers up its banal story by some pretty slick shooting devices , which include fast-paced editing and jump-cuts , and at times , when taking on the killer's point of view , making the beautiful color go grainy with a hand-held video camera , which is meant to signify that there is some kind of mystery going on .	0
it's mainly an emotionally flat , one running joke type of lightweight literary film that is done in by a very dull middle section and too much unnecessary gore .the director-writer nicholas meyer ( star trek 11 ) -- he also wrote the witty novel " seven percent solution " -- worked the screenplay from his own novel , showing some clever touches here and there , but not enough to hold my interest for the duration of the film .the film suffered from being too poorly presented , as it always appeared less than exciting , nevertheless it was occasionally diverting , and some cult sci-fi fans might like it more than the general public should .	0
this is a lame coming-of-age film , yet michael corrente directs it with great sympathy for the characters , taking a lighthearted approach to some mild rebellion going on in the mid '70s , contrasting the lifestyles of both working-class and upper-class students .in the silliness that goes for either comedy or dramatics , which wasn't funny or enlightening , just stupid and incredible , dunph goes to the brown university dean and pleads for jane to be taken back , supposedly proving that he learned something about personal responsibility at the prep school .it all seemed like a futile effort to catch something about class status that had already been caught in a better light by recent films like " rushmore " and " slums of beverly hills . "	0
this very bitter film , a retread of " the blue angel , " might appeal to fans of the great french actress jeanne moreau , in one of her best performances ever , who plays eva with a true intensity .the jazzy musical score is by michel legrand , and the great billie holiday song " weep for me , " is most appropriate for the down mood the film idles on from beginning to end .it's film that basically is asking two unanswerable questions : how do you explain a woman's love for a guy who is no good ?	0
it is more of a joke than a serious film , as all it tries to do is push the boundaries of technical innovation , while it neglects the basics of movie making : character development and the telling of a good story .the film was most like one of those stationary camcorder sites that they have on the internet , of say , some street corner , where the viewer hopes the time he spends is not wasted and something spontaneous will unfold to make it worth his while .it was awkwardly done , seemingly ruining whatever natural effect was aimed for in telling this story in real time .	0
this is a film with so much unrealized potential , about the icy heroine of the story , the tough-minded half-american and half-greenland inuit , smilla jaspersen ( julia ormond ) , who seemingly stepped into a hole in the ice before the film's finale and was ludicrously transformed from a captivating noir personality to a typical hollywood action heroine .smilla's sense of snow presents a mysterious story relying on tense local atmosphere , enigmatic characters and twists in the plot , to spin its dark tale of a heroine looking to find her roots again .the danish director , bille august , who tries to be faithful to his fellow countryman's source material , presents a glossy and sleek looking film that inherits all the virtues and vices of the book , and comes up short in the end because it cannot overcome how utterly ludicrous the story becomes .	0
this fluff film fails to be absorbing because it is so sugary and forgettable , but with that being said , it still had a few tender moments that seemed worth while .the grunge rock scene was fun to watch , the characters were more likable than not , there was a lot of tenderness shown for those who get hurt in relationships , and the film is emotionally as sweet as pie .the film could be best enjoyed for its soundtrack , which includes the music of soundgarden , mudhoney , alice in chains and pearl jam in the background .	0
a very obvious melodrama about the relationship of a southern-white trash mother-daughter .the story is not the thing here , but the unflappable , zesty performance janet mcteer gives , as she becomes absorbed in her part and plays it with emotional force , carrying this picture for all its worth .i just thought the mother-daughter were likable and the film was pleasant , but not far-reaching .	0
cahn , in this aip cheapie , provides some amusing hokum exploiting the occult-horror b-film genre in a very hollywood type of way .the cahn way of filming these seances is more funny than scary .this is strictly lightweight nonsense , which should be good for a few laughs .	0
a routine ww11 submarine action picture , featuring an unknown cast , though in a few years the film's star , james caan , was to get his breakthrough role in " the godfather . "half of the film concerns the serious training the men undergo under the watchful eye of the stern bolton .it's a well crafted actioner with a terse and fast-paced story , and should be acceptable for those who don't mind that the movie is a clich ?	0
as a full-length feature , it ran out of gas shortly after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at what is really troubling about pop culture .here , dorff is good enough as the abby hoffman characterization of a punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist , while griffith is a good sport , taking in all the remarks about honey's age , her ego-centredness , her tantrums , her phony public demeanor and her defense of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a hollywood star , first defending and then renouncing it .the satire was not tough enough to make this a biting film , but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption to really antagonize anyone but the christian right-wing moralists .	0
i would think that three strikes and you're out should apply to any more of these space bombs cast into theaters by producers with big budgets and small stories .south african director anthony hoffman directs without imagination , as the film seems to drag on at a lethargic pace .i think hollywood should reevaluate its plans to make these special effect only films about mars and see if they can go back to the drawing board and put some life into these stories about the earth's last frontier .	0
adolfas has come up with an offbeat , lighthearted romantic/comedy spoof , that gently mocks france's new wave cinema , which was the vogue among intellectuals at the time .there is no political message or drug visualizations here , as the film tends to rely on the energy conveyed by the characters and the fun they seemed to be having with this unpredictable material they had to work with .the comedy part of the film had the feel of those buster keaton silent ones .	0
i found its build-up to the climax , where secrets would be bared about how meeker got to be the way he was , not worth the wait in finding out .what the film did well was show that after the war many americans thirsted for a better standard of life and thought they could get it in the suburbs .meeker was particularly effective in being a sympathetic figure , craving for affection and love , in this low-key human interest story .	0
a film advertised as an exploitive film about steamy sex that fails to deliver that part of the bargain , but delivers an expose on white slavery practices in new york city at the turn of the century .in my opinion , they should have chosen to make artistic films like von stroheim's silent classic 'greed' ( 25 ) , instead of taking this more exploitive and superficial path .but that doesn't prevent this film from being an interesting watch .	0
but all that is still not enough to stop the thinly plotted story from dragging in spots , bringing on a dullness to its critical life-and-death situations , and falling into clich ?it just stalls and falls into a rather trite escapade into the jungles to rescue an american engineer from revolutionaries who are caricatured as being stupid , cruel , lazy , and high on drugs .the film just didn't have too much juice in its hackneyed story , or in its generalized characterization of revolutionaries , oil moguls , and heroes .	0
it was unable to get theater bookings , even with the star-studded cast and paul schrader's prestigious name listed as the screenwriter and director , and even though it played at the toronto and telluride film festivals .that idea might have sounded good on paper , but when shot on film , the steamy love story turns out to be dull , mainly because fiennes and mol didn't seem to connect , there was hardly any electricity between the two when in each other's arms .ray liotta's corrupt world of politics and business , seemed too generalized a characterization to give spice to the story .	0
the fast-paced story , the crisp editing , and the atmospheric music plus all the schlock horror it could throw out to the audience by using those traditional podlike aliens , helped make this a silly venture geared mainly for the under 25 crowd ( i'm not only referring to age , but to i .if there is enjoyment to be found , it's in the frantic moments when the students are acting out their stereotypes and some of the vilest things come up out of their wiser-than-they-should-be mouths .it's a cult film for those with a taste for earwigs , a stomach for slop , and an appetite for mind altering drugs .	0
a mystery thriller from the pen of daphne du maurier , tepidly adapted to the screen from gore vidal's murky script in a workman-like way by robert hamer .the film's main fault was that it failed to maintain a level of tension for its mystery story , and the three weeks that barratt played at being a french nobleman was hardly believable .the middle part of it seemed to be going nowhere and by the time the payoff came , the confrontation between the morally concerned barratt and the villainous count , seemed too artificial and lifeless for me to give its supposedly shocking outcome a second thought .	0
the old-fashioned values displayed give the film a dated look , and all the manipulative situations prevent this film from being viewed as anything but a star vehicle , which should be pleasing for pickford fans .the film had a few heartwarming moments : mom dancing an irish jig , terry taking his date pickford home and then -- climbing up the rickety steps of the tenement and looking chagrined as he was thwarted from kissing her as she toyed with him , and there was also the playful mood displayed by pickford with all the men in her life , not a bit envious of her so-called betters , proud of the inner character she has .even the film should be of special interest to mary pickford fans and to those who want to see why she was considered " america's sweetheart . "	0
yet korine didn't seem to trust all this poetry he was spreading about and needs to end the film in a conventional way , with a dramatic scene regarding the pregnancy of chloe sevigny .i appreciate the effort for originality attempted here , especially with the abundance of formula mainstream and indie films pushed at the public , but i would like to see something more intellectually demanding than just a rant against conventional filmmaking .the filmmaking skills are there , but as of yet , i don't see the 25-year-old director moving too far from the childish shock scenes he threw at the audience for his first film .	0
a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown .it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film .lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen .	0
since i wasn't held in suspense , i instead turned my attention on guessing who did it , using my conditioned experiences from watching such tv shows , therefore i knew it wouldn't be the most obvious one .set in a city hospital , the film pays homage to soap operas like general hospital , as in numerous scenes a patient is seen watching the unnamed soap opera , as is the bartender where the doctors hangout , rosie ( ann wedgeworth ) .the b-film left a warm spot in my heart , as it cured my insomnia without me using a sleeping pill and having to worry about side effects .	0
it takes a stab at being an intelligent slasher movie for those who like their gore laced with some sensible dialogue to go along with its good and evil characterizations .the surreal forest sets the dark mood for philip ridley's eerie and atmospheric film .what propels this film is not the slight story , but the bold interactions among the characters and the striking symbolic conflict over strict biblical interpretations versus a worldly sensual view of life .	0
a modern day western adapted from cormac mccarthy's national book award-winning novel of 1992 , which was accurately transferred to film by ted tally's script , as it kept the same laconic cowboy dialogue from the book intact , but was reduced considerably from the over three hour length director billy bob thornton originally shot it in , to under two hours , the length the people from miramax wanted it .what he got is something that plays more like a slick magazine photo shoot on the travails of being a cowboy , or as a touristy travelogue of what the old west was like , or as a stylish film that can't find what it wants to say and stumbles around in the grimness of a prosaic story about youthful aspirations .what it lacked was some emotional kick , as the scenes where the cowboys show off their spirited exuberance , seemed more portentous than not and just didn't jive with the unsure pace of the film .	0
a tour of nurv's ultra-modern geek headquarters , which is a campus with multi-buildings and satellites on it , fills us in on the atmosphere around such high-tech complexes .he's really fun to watch in his understated but brilliant performance as the sociopath billionaire , a clone of bill gates .the filmmaker had a chance to say something , but prefers to play it safe and come up with a possible blockbuster out of a film rife with mindless action sequences .	0
in this fluff piece , which the director calls a " screwball noir , " it suffers mostly because its mixture of being a formula noir tale and a comic farce is overtaken by its forced comedy and a story that has little drama in it , but it perks up at times because of the charming performances by all concerned and the constant barrage of wacky dialogue .the film starts off in an amusingly pleasant way , as trixie's banter is laced with continuous malapropisms such as , 'by hook or ladder , ' 'he smokes like a fish , ' and 'nobody is human . 'the film's strongest scene is set on red's boat , where violence and a possible sense of an orgy happening clouds the pleasure cruise .	0
it reminded me most of " the father of the bride , " only it didn't have spencer tracy's assurances that everything would turn out ok , as the film looked real good for the first 70 minutes and then slid into tedium and then into a contrived ending ala " the graduate . "it's ready made for an audience that applauds when two people who are meant for each other , wind up with each other no matter what .hollywood loves churning out stories like that because they're good box office and have mass appeal .	0
a sometimes engaging indie film about three best friends growing up in nyc , that is a heartfelt story but is hampered by its awkward dialogue and unfulfilling plot .went to coney island " never got untracked , though it had some bright dramatic moments and some perceptive comic offerings , but it could never come together as a complete picture .it was also done in by a needless subplot of stan getting into gambling debts and being beaten , which just seemed like padding to a thin story .	0
a poor imitation of lubitsch's classic romance/comedy trouble in paradise .even though it is terribly outdated for modern audiences , it was seen as the height of fashion at its time as for style and dress .it was a witty depression eye-pleaser for american audiences who liked to watch the rich in action , especially seeing them get robbed of their jewels .	0
there's something whimsical to be said about universal-international's most strained sci-fi film of the 1950s , it sunk to new lows to get to its subject matter .in this heavy-handed message film , the main theme depicts how intolerant people could be who hide behind their religious beliefs blindly and continue to keep others ignorant of the truth .the adventure was clumsily made and was too pedantic to be good cinema .	0
in an interview he gave for cable tv , he said he didn't mind that this hollywood film took some liberties with his story to juice it up sexually so we can see leonardo romance the beautiful virginie ledoyen and have another affair with tilda swinton , additions that were not part of the novel .overrated director , danny boyle ( " a life less ordinary " / " trainspotting " / " shallow grave " ) , is skilled at working his magic on films that are basically insubstantial by relying on non-narrative things to do the job , such as the energy from the actors and the beauty in his visual sets .here , he is aided by the wonderfully gifted cinematographer , darius khondji , who makes the beach look like a cross between the figment of one's psychedelic dream and an ongoing computer game , something you can't take your eyes off .	0
a sci-fi film , originally started as a student project , noted only for its great special effects , as created by dennis muren .the problem with this film -- that came 30 years before blair witch project and has its same scary themes played out in the woods by students -- is its amateur acting , shoddy production values , horrible script , and ridiculous story .the remainder of the film is a testimony to the special effects created on such a limited budget , but the story can only be constued as ridiculous , as the four young students who must have taken stupid pills to still be hanging around in the woods , continue on with their adventure .	0
a mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it presents andy warhol's dictum that , in the future , everybody will be famous for 15 minutes , and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving around how everyone is enchanted by fame , either wanting to be a celebrity or to gawk at them .it also presents an annoyingly didactic message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the rules , as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale .the good part of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention grabbing psychopathic villain ( karel roden ) challenging the self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective ( de niro ) , which makes for vulgar entertainment .	0
it features style over substance and is less worried about storytelling than in looking odd and being confusingly mod .it can best be enjoyed for its visual beauty , especially , in its smoky gothic images of the manhattan skyline and the luxury residence of the antiheroes .since this info is only clear by reading the book , this film makes a gross error in its filmmaking decisions by not letting these details out of the bag in its storytelling .	0
the director , carlos saura , has had trouble with the storytelling part of his films in the past , as his great craftsmanship skills seem to far exceed his other abilities as a filmmaker .it seemed like a dry lecture , with the artist's paintings laboriously put on display , making for some gorgeous framed shots , but not offering a film that is emotionally touching .what we learn is that goya was a flawed man , feeling himself to be cowardly and weak-spirited at times , whose great influences to overcome his shortcomings were , vel ?	0
it's a bizarre psychological story with lots of hitchcock's psycho in it .it's a disturbing film about a hostage situation involving an insane religious fanatic .tallulah bankhead plays the bible quoting nut mrs .	0
to see it in the next century , is to watch how a bad film could still be around because it has attained cult-film status .the monster turns out to be a bit cranky and is not completely obedient to his master .the film's violent climax for some reason switches out of it b&w format and goes into technicolor .	0
this is an obscure bela lugosi film and it's not bad .bela's the bad guy with a foreign accent .his fans will love him here , as this film has been restored recently and is now watchable .	0
it's good in parts , but it fails to deliver in its unbelievable surprise ending .	0
an enigmatic thriller that never quite gets going .it's always too enigmatic and bleak , and its surprise ending falls like a dead weight into a waterfalls .it's a film that successfully and darkly explores the motives of its three female characters and their ambiguous relationships with others .	0
the film is most successful in hiding its plot twists and its surprise ending but , in going for that and that alone , the film lost track of how unbelievable the story was becoming and how shallow all the characters were , except for the morgan freeman character .morgan freeman played the same role in the 1997's kiss the girls , and that mediocre film brought in lots of dough ( $60 million ) .the fun in this film might be in making a list of all the holes in the story , and whoever comes up with the first hundred wins a prize .	0
the highs from " blow " come mostly from the colorful fashion show it parades before us and depp's brilliantly nuanced performance , as he shows off his inscrutability and his swagger , where he challenges us to be sympathetic to him even if he's a lowlife drug dealer and an uninteresting character , whose selfish dream is all about himself accumulating money and material happiness .the movie plays it real safe , as the only users the audience sees are the flashy hollywood types that no one cares about . "blow " suffered because it was too simplistic in its storytelling , in its nonjudgmental stance on drugs , and in shamelessly pulling the audience to the side of the nice guy drug dealer , george jung .	0
a fast-paced film noir about corruption and double-crosses , that has a lot of plot twists and a nifty surprise ending .the film was cheaply made and the acting didn't distinguish itself .it's not a bad watch , but lovers of film noir should like it more than others .	0
a fair remake of the 1930 and 1920 versions of this film .a very conventional film .	0
a routine mystery story with a misleading title .this low budget film is watchable , but do not expect anything more than that .	0
legendary schlockmeister ed wood cited for winning the golden turkey award for worst director of all time and for bad films such as glen or glenda , bride of the monster , and plan 9 from outer space , and for being an inspiration to all bad directors , tries desperately to make a film noir out of jail bait .unfortunately , this film is not as prone to unintended laughs as his others and therefore fails to live up to what the director has built his reputation on . "jail bait " is a misleading title for the film , as it is a phrase that usually refers to underaged women .	0
the woman character immerses herself in raw nature as a means of reinvigorating her energy and escaping from her dull life .what happens next is too murky and not convincingly established to be totally believable , as things moved too fast without the viewer seeing what was happening ; not enough is ever revealed for us to comprehend what is behind her sudden conflict , except for her husband's lies and her fatal attraction for his brother .n bauer's musical score for classic argentinean guitar and cello , which played in the background throughout the film .	0
a complex contemporary horror flick based on a novel by whitley strieber , that is slow in developing and when it becomes evident what's happening there's more interest intellectually in what is uncovered than thrills .outstanding british cinematographer gerry fisher does the honors of making this a very stylish looking film , which gives the impression that something deeper than what appears to be happening is taking place .all the camera shots are presented in this manner , showing how the wolves can pick up man's scent much quicker than he can theirs and their heat-seeking vision can detect their quarry's body temperature .	0
if you forget a little thing like the story doesn't make sense and the theater you are in supplies you with bon-bons , then there's a chance you might be lulled into accepting this flashy summertime film at face value and be pleased by it .the film has a snappy " pulp fiction " like start to it , as a puffy john travolta stares into the camera and his first words are : " you know what the problem with hollywood is - they make shit . "john travolta thinks he's houdini , but he seems more like a guy getting good money for playing a part that required little acting skills other than to just look sinister and smile occasionally .	0
as is the custom in a french film of this kind , love is the most important thing in the world .at first , we don't know what to make of antoine , whether he's a psycho or just a drifter , as his straggly appearance is not appealing to ang ?it's a sexy french romp into familiar territory , with characters who don't tell us much about what's inside them .	0
aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives .it's not an easy film to find comfort in , or feel anything but revulsion at the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place .i can applaud the director for his visual style of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the screen in a realistic way , but the story of four losers who can't get out of brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss attached to it .	0
a spaghetti western that can't be ruined by poor dubbing , an outlandishly gross tale , dialogue that is meaningless , acting that's the pits , a body count for enemies that would satisfy the pentagon during the entire vietnam war , an acrobat who annoyingly can't stop doing flips , an obnoxious strolling banjo player with a rifle hidden in its neck , a drunk knife-thrower , one-dimensional villains , and an assortment of nonsensical gun duels .this film is so bad , so lacking in humor and romance , or any possible relation to reality , yet it is still mindlessly entertaining .there's a lot of spaghetti tossed about in this conventional hollywood looking plot but , nevertheless , typical italian action western .	0
a disturbing drama , inspired by a true story , that rails against the hypocritical sexual attitudes of the times .the first-time filmmaker , philip goodhew , takes us behind the nice lace curtains of a respectable british household and brings us a story of repression , jealousy , and obsession .it's a well-made but grimly unmoving film , that dwells on an unpleasant subject , that culminates in a gruesome double homicide .	0
this makes for a grim drama that is intelligently directed by actor tim roth , in his first directorial effort , as adapted from the novel by alexander stuart , who also did the screenplay ; the performances as well as the photography of the haunting countryside are first-rate , but nothing particularly insightful materializes about this sexually abusive situation .the tension slowly builds in a household that appears outwardly as a loving one , until it reaches its expected boiling point .this doesn't leave the audience much room to do anything but gasp at the shameful situation presented and the dirty little secret that too many families find themselves in and can't deal with .	0
jay anania's second feature is a very cold , intellectual film that asks the question : can we have a memory of what we only imagined ?it's imitative in its minimalist style of a robert bresson film .to go along with the somber and ridiculously serious tone of the movie , there are moody vocals by judy kuhn .	0
the emptiness of this film and why its story is so unsatisfying in comparison with its acidy acting and rollicking photography is because english director , jonathan glazer , comes to filmmaking in his debut feature from music videos and television commercials ; he has succeeded only in making a violent film that is ugly below its surface beauty .it's a film that discourages thinking and aggressively forces one to revel in the forceful acting jobs going on by the over-the-edge performance by sociopath ben kingsley , and the understated ones by retired nice guy thief ray winstone and brazen mobster boss ian mcshane .the film could have used subtitles because the cockney was laid on so thick it was almost incomprehensible to this american's ears .	0
warner oland's final appearance as charlie chan is marred because this is one of the weaker episodes in the long running series .the story was too muddled and not too crisply executed .for comedy , lee's misuse of french leads to some embarrassing situations and joubert's choppy english and inflated pride in his bumbling police department leads to some amusing moments .	0
the best thing about the film was falk's tough-guy performance .otherwise , everything was routine .	0
unfortunately because of that glitch in the story and the film's gapping holes in logic , i wasn't absorbed by this moody and atmospheric thriller as much as i should have been .when you see how the film will be resolved before the main character does and that person is playing a psychic , then there is something amiss about the story .the two things that kept this film watchable were the suspenseful visuals of annie's dark visions -- eerily recalling things from the dead world , and cate's gifted performance , that brought more to the story than the script by billy bob thornton and tom epperson could provide .	0
a so-so noir melodrama , that can't overcome its limited script and unbelievable premise of a career woman who gives it all up to live a boring life with the husband she's madly in love with .what keeps this melodrama going is the understated star performances generated by raymond burr and sterling hayden , bouncing off the fiercely passionate portrayal stanwyck gives .kathy gets involved in an outlandish situation , in many ways similar but a lot more deadly than those situations she used to make fun of when she wrote her lovelorn column .	0
rita hayworth has a bit part as a servant , while stepin fetchit plays his usual stereotyped role--this might be offensive to some .this was a lackluster suspense story , which at times seems more like a horror film ; and , the actors didn't distinguish themselves .but the film gave off some egyptian charm , those borrowed from a long list of hollywood b-movies .	0
an uneven production marred by some ethnic slurs against a black butler ( muse ) and by holes in the mystery story , yet had its moments of sheer joy and ends up being a below average entry but can still be enjoyed as your typical charlie chan formula mystery story .there were also a healthy dosage of slurs against the hindus ; such as , the cops saying : " they all look alike to me . "too many tacked on explanations still can't clear up all the discrepancies , but that shouldn't really matter to the die-hard fans of the series .	0
it was a little hard to find this mystery story credible and the acting was uneven , as many of the supporting characters weren't convincing in their roles .but there's the usual charlie chan formula stuff to keep his fans relatively satisfied with this weaker than average one in the series .	0
polar ( director/writer/editor : jacques bral ; screenwriter : from a book by jean-patrick manchette " morgue pleine " /jean-paul leca ; cinematographers : jacques renoir/jean-paul rosa da costa ; editors : anne boissel/noun serra ; cast : jean-fran ?ois balmer ( eugene tarpon ) , sandra montaigu ( charlotte le dantex ) , pierre santini ( inspecteur coccioli ) , roland dubillard ( jean-baptiste haymann ) , claude chabrol ( theadore lyssenko ) , jean-paul bonnaire ( gerard sergent ) , marc dudicourt ( le loup ) , g ?sar ) , jean-louis foulquier ( alfonsino ) ; runtime : 97 ; les films noris ; 1984-france ) a dark , atmospheric film noir from france , that followed to the letter all the conventions of that genre .	0
this revenge film was fast-paced and well-acted , but its story is too far-fetched to be completely convincing .	0
a strangely crafted cult-mystery story that is not resolved in a tidy manner , as it asks the viewer to decide if what they saw was the protagonist's hallucination or something real !the film ends up feeling like a case study for paranoia and madness , more than it does a mystery story .though , david hemmings' convincing performance gives this film a creepy mood to hang its hat on .	0
the story never seemed credible , as their actions were weird but not explainable .this was a bleak tale , but in a perverse way it was fun to see such a woeful collection of misfits .esther howard added her brand of misogyny to the mix by acting so daffy , and showing some gumption as she spits on trevor .	0
it was a fascinating scene , darkly capturing the tortured mind of chuck and the stifling atmosphere of cuba during the mid-forties .this film noir is memorable for its dark , dream-like feel , as reality becomes indistinguishable from the dream sequences .because of those shots , this film became a cult classic ; but , it is one that is rarely shown on tv .	0
a fine example of a 1940s type of film noir , as adapted from a cornell woolrich novel .the acting was commendable and the development of the dark noir world was very well established ; but , the case itself seemed hardly believable-- the dialogue was atrocious , and the crazed , genius killer looking down at his hands and getting dizzy spells was more ridiculous than a truthful presentation .the film had too many defects that just couldn't be overlooked , yet overall it had a mesmerizing effect--largely due to the imaginative direction robert siodmak gave it .	0
a monogram cheapie that holds up fairly well as a low-budget b-film noir , featuring robert mitchum in his first starring role .it's directed by the noted schlock thriller director william castle , who lets the story simply unfold and doesn't embellish it with the gimmicks he was later on to employ in his career of making horror exploitation films .it's a minor film , but it does a good job of providing some thrills and has its moments of pure visual delights : like of hunter staring out her hotel window and her face illuminated by a flashing neon sign as jazz sounds are coming from the street .	0
a rather flat film noir that never gets that interesting .it's the simpleness of this tale and lack of any pretensions that makes it convincing but not necessarily sparkling .	0
a fairly entertaining charlie chan mystery , but with the new studio monogram taking over for 20th century fox the production values were much cheaper .it wasn't too difficult to pick out the spy , but nevertheless the film was still pleasing in spots .	0
it's a visual treat , thanks to the lush camera work of nicolas roeg , but leaves a lot to be desired in its wooden story and characterizations .the point of the film is vincent price's absolutely diabolical performance , no campy routine here .it's a performance showing pure evil and the reward is at the end watching him get his just desserts .	0
the film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess .though , it's entertaining as it takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it takes to be a modern artist , let's us eyeball jodie foster in the nude , and has dennis hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man who wants to be loved and play the sax like charlie parker .it ends with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil refinery explosion .	0
there was one very good trick photography shot of jon hall putting his invisible arm into an aquarium , the arm becoming visible like a bubble and then with water delineating his invisible face to make it visible to those he's threatening .but it is the script that does it in , as the invisible man is made into a heartless villain and the storyline was very weak .this hokum story could have and should have been more entertaining , but it still had the presence of the legendary john carradine to give the flick some spice to it .	0
it maintains the eerie atmosphere by getting into the strange rituals and manifestations required from such a look at the dark side , but fails to prove enlightening and is uneven in its presentation as the ending allows the film to go up in a puff of hokey smoke ( stockwell and begley oppose each other offering up their curses in an undeciferable language , until the evil stockwell gets struck by lightning ) .but this version attempted by director daniel haller ( monster of terror ) , is much better at getting at the freakish meaning of lovecraft than his previous film .while the brooding dean stockwell seemed right at home with all the weirdness his role called for as a warlock , yet he gave a boring performance as if he was drugged and reduced to speak in a monotone voice throughout .	0
a superficial scare film that makes a feeble attempt to serve up hamlet as its theme , but that's a stretch .the house itself is smothered in a cold , aqua blue , as the production designer , jon gary steele , and the director of photography , alar kivilo , have made the set to look like a clone of the antagonistic and cold-hearted terry glass .this is basically a film that put a great effort into getting the sets it wanted to be right , but failed to get anything more out of this absurd tale .	0
this is a film that uses the porn business as its background , but is really about the loneliness and the corruption of an individual .this low-budget indie is mostly a character study of how 'an ordinary guy' such as paul could descend into the seedy world of porno all because he doesn't know how to get a date .the film had little emotional impact even though the story was exploitive and aimed to get sympathy for its victims .	0
its saving grace is that it is well presented .it is narrated in a serious tone by reed hadley .	0
it was bloody , filled with violent action scenes that should please the kind of audience that gravitates toward that sort of thing , and most of all it was very aggressive in attitude without much to say about anything but the criminals .but the film fails to get you to care for any of these characters , though it tries hard to get you to believe that ray is not a bad guy .it just seems like another mindless film in a long list of streetwise crime stories that are now hard to remember because they all seem to run together .	0
this experience he clearly used in boycott , and that plays a major part in understanding the director's continual growth and ability to change .the film is a rambling , action-packed hollywood style ( for the most part ) , surreal , and politically motivated thriller--with car chases and shootouts .the film never convincingly showed valeh as anything but a political lightweight without guts , so when he explains while in prison how naive he was to join the terrorists it sounds almost laughable when he says : " i fight , therefore i am .	0
this one is set in modern la and filled with pointless violence , and with nothing relevant to say about its dirty cop subject matter .the way it ended made no sense , as this smorgasbord in violence had gangs of blacks , mexicans , and even russians , interact with corrupt city law enforcers .it becomes apparent that alonzo doesn't follow the book , as he plays mind games with jake and plants the seeds that you either do things my way or it's back to hum-drum police work with no promotions in sight .	0
it is a good mindless , violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened , such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern ( and , you know how serious that stuff was ) .the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago , with its tall buildings and el trains , adding a dark shade to its story .the only thing it fails to pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s and 50s , is that their heroes were really underdogs , they were fighting the system , not out for their own ends and vanity only .	1
a quaint irish village , replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics , a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road , a bunch of likable locals , colorful scenery , wonderful irish pipes heard in the background , and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film , with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it .that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised , by getting rid of the fly in the ointment , the one character in the village that upset its tranquility .they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated .	1
by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore , much of this is done off-screen , which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem , the director is able to keep the film arty .everything about these two is a facade , their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up , their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed , realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film , despite the director's aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation , to reduce everyone to a cartoon image , to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life .i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out , and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art , it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently .	1
rudolph takes a rather cynical and tongue-in-cheek view of that art scene , capturing the mood and the atmosphere of that period , shooting this highly entertaining and for him , accessible film , in a dazzling display of color , representative of the art produced at that time by picasso , cezanne , matisse and modigliani .his love and understanding of this time period shows up very well , as a result , he creates his best film to date .the parisian scene is topped off by an emotionally sentimental hemingway ( o'connor ) , showing up at all the right parties , sitting at the right cafes , drinking to excess and plying his craft , while thinking aloud , as his philosphy comes off as just so much drivel , with him appearing shallow and hopelessly american despite his presence in paris at precisely the right time for an american to be there .	1
this film doesn't claim to capture the accuracy of its shakespeare production ( it even relishes in the inaccuracies it presents ; ex .i had no problem adopting myself to the cleverness of tom stoppard's screenplay , though i am usually turned off by films that think they can get by on that one note .fiennes' shakespeare seemed a little too flighty for my taste , i just don't think will was like that and despite this fictonalized account of will , it still bothered me to see him look so lost , at times .	1
elmore leonard novels have become staples for the movies in recent times , they become movies easily translated into money making glossy thrillers , noted for their amusing dialogue and smartly made stories .clooney and lopez work well together , there is a chemistry between them on screen that belies the unbelievability of the story they are in .the film is violent , it is sexy , it has romance and comedy in it , in fact , it has just about everything in it , except real intelligence , but then again , what results is a quick-paced actioner , that is easy to watch , and easy for the viewer to let his hair down a bit and be less critical , for this film is a well-conceived star vehicle that works on all cylinders of the entertainment scale .	1
their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths , as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime , still too naive to comprehend their total situation .since the film can't possibly give us much to say about bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty , we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face , can somehow make it on his own .and i think , that is the most critical thing that i can say about this often funny , mostly bleak , derivative film , that was credibly but not compellingly acted , in reality , leaving no visual impact on me , it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and , besides , the enjoyment of it wasn't that great to begin with .	1
but the film is boring at times and belabors its points , and goes on for too long without seeming to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction ; and , is at best , an uneven attempt to say something serious ( which hartley should be applauded for ) .but the film gets bogged down in telling too many different stories , such as , one of domesticity , neighborhood values , and the business of getting published .it just didn't add up as a work of drama , it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character .	1
when i was taking college courses in psychology , which is quite awhile ago , i learned that this kind of disorder didn't have to lead to such ill-mannered behavior as melvin displays .well , nicholson was real funny doing this compulsive schtick that borders on his just being a turd most of the time , but at his edgiest moments , when he crosses the line of common decency and reaches a point where the audience might not like him anymore , he brought the most laughter to the screen .but the film couldn't take a chance of sticking to this unsafe type of humor and went back to its safer plot .	1
without john hurt's magnificent performance , he appears in every scene and is very apealing , this film would have fallen flat on its face .the comic effects of the film seem light enough , that is until the homo-erotic pulsations become overbearing , and we are left , in the end , with a rather awkward drama being played out , that is somehat unnerving to behold , made plausible only by hurt's presence as a commanding performer .yet it is tastefully done , but not as biting as thomas mann's film version of the same theme , death in venice .	1
tango is a romantic musical , supposedly influenced by fellini's 8 1/2 , with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood , that is , for a saura film .saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather terse storyline , which means that if you don't care for the tango , you could find yourself bored with this slow-moving story .what is exceptional about this film , is how superbly choreographed and stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is , as its cinematographer is the great vittorio storaro ( last tango in paris ) .	1
this is a gritty , workman-like ww11 hbo made for tv movie , that is much better , surprisingly , than most of those kind of movies usually are , taking place in a battlefield in the hurtgen forest , 1944 , on the border of belgium and germany , though it was shot in hungary .in a year when two epic war films were made , saving private ryan and the thin red line , this low budget movie holds its own with those films storywise , only lacking the great cinematography of those films , but its cinematography was realistic enough , aiding in the clarity of telling the story , that is highlighted by an engaging characterization by ron eldard and the other soldiers who look as if they are really ww11 soldiers .now this has been tried in many of the older ww11 films , but for the most part , it didn't work because the acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are .	1
what remained constantly grating throughout the film , was ricci's snide voice-over comments that were politically incorrect : insulting gays and holding a negative view of sex .she dresses in tartish , campy outfits , and is always smoking a cigarette , adding to the film's theme of being opposite to what is expected of a teen .if one is looking for some deep meaning , then one will be pleased by lovett's reflective statement to lisa , " that sex isn't just for recreation or procreation , but for concentration - that when making love , the experience allows one to relate wholly with someone else so that one can forget their loneliness . "	1
the film's title signifies the thin red line that one crosses between sanity and insanity in a war situation .the images of the dead in the swamp , tagged with dogtags in their mouth , was appalling to behold , it is a scene that should leave one feeling a bit eerie .this is a blunt statement , but after all the bloody battle scenes observed , and the heavy losses on both sides , it is a fair question to ask and the response might not be one that can be taken literally , but it is one that is wrapped around a lot of emotions that can't be articulated properly but can sure be felt .	1
demme has sort of solved the literary problem by making this film into a ghost story , as the strong visualizations are used as metaphors for the inhumanity of slavery and the lasting impressions it stamps on the minds of the victims .but i was not crazy about the casting of oprah in the major role of the film , she was certainly adequate for the part ( there was a stoic strength about her that was needed in her performance , and she provided that ) , but she did not show a deep enough range of emotions that a more accomplished actress would have shown .that she evolves as the story moves on and learns how to take care of herself , is one of the refreshing surprises that comes about , as kimberley's performance is very gratifying and touching to behold , especially to see how she matures and grows up from her very weak stature in life .	1
a zippy youth oriented christmas movie ( though there is no bing singing white christmas in this one ) marketed for the druggie generation of post-teens and those in their late 20s , that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's largest share of ticket buyers , as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale , ( pulp fiction type dialogue and style ) , fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace , using the cool life-style in lala land as its backdrop , and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills .in this frenetically paced film , the innovative young director , doug liman , following his indie debut feature , swingers , shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world , as he grapples with their realities , giving us a good look at how they view themselves , their job and their customers .in any case , go has watch ability because of its raw energy , and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high .	1
it is filmed with calm detachment , in black-and- white , giving the film a taut look , as the action is sharp and ruthless , by men who are all business .it is interesting to see how melville could make a low level hood like gus , into a seemingly ethical person , that is , within the standards of the criminal mind , and be deemed as an almost sympathetic and , at the same time , pathetic figure , whose crime spree , though unforgiveable , will nevertheless , offer us something about him that is redeeming , that even the wily inspector bleu recognizes .this is not great noir , because the acting seemed jarred , but it has a certain tension in it that sustains its somber mood .	1
altman's other aims are to uncover all the town's little nasty secrets that is so easily hidden by its southern hospitality and history of racism .the film's decency shines through all the past racial injustices , and maybe things are getting better in the south , at least that is the message we are left with , and i see no reason to be of a different opinion .race relations might be the biggest problem americans are still faced with , and finding a cordial way out of it is the aim of a lot of good folks .	1
i must confess , i never cared for bacon's art , though i was somewhat impressed with the raw power of his blood curling images and the deathlike objectivity he gives his work .to know one of the contraries is not enough , as it probably means that you can't even see that as clearly as you should , as in bacon's case , what evil is for him to see , is mostly felt as a raging flux inside , something jacobi captured on screen , that made this film a very special one , and saved it from the doldrums it could have been .what comes to my mind is the risible performances of charlton heston as micheangelo and kirk douglas as van gogh , or more recently leonard di caprio trying to be convincing as an unknown artist in titanic .	1
i just wish cusack would lose that coy smile he seems to bring with him in every role he has , it is starting to wear tiredly lame on him .these stars make their characters seem more real than they have a right to be , because the story is just too thin to carry much weight on it , except to follow its commercial instincts and provide the audience with enough obvious action sequences to keep the pace of the film moving at jet speed , allowing hardly any time for one to sit back and think about the real turbulence that could have been experienced about traffic controllers' stress from the job .the chaos and controlled confusion in the tower , and close camaraderie waffling in the air between the controllers and even their bosses was fun to watch , as well as giving the audience a chance to be looking over their shoulders at the computer screens they work with , giving an accurate and colorful view of the job they do .	1
unfortunately , we have to hear this whining for most of the film , until he acts natural , and bingo , something good happens to this dude , who i must fess up and say , i felt nothing at all for .he represents the heart and soul of the swingers and gives the film a comedic tone , that at times , as silly as it is , is downright funny .if you have a strong stomach and can take the staleness of the story , you might find it funny enough , and actually enjoy it , realizing , in all seriousness , that this is the way it is for many heterosexuals , and it is always hard to change the way it is , no pun intended .	1
it is beautifully filmed in the style of a formal chinese landscape painting , using the commonplace to be viewed as something that goes beyond its present linear form , to give it an eternal flavor from what it might first appear like .he mails most of the money he stole to qiuyi , and he gives enough for xiao to have a week's worth of pleasure .this is a most interesting but not particularly penetrating film to come out of modern china , one that is most blunt and cruel in picking up the human travails and emotional discontentments that the people faced in the hands of their liberators , but not able to say too much about why these hardships are taking place .	1
but life on the reservation seems stale and confining ; yet , everyone , at least , has some material comforts , as they all seem to live in a house and enjoy their fried bread .it does not suffer from the usual clich=e9s of indian films , as it artfully weaves a story wavering between despair and comic acceptance of the native american plight .i recommend this film for its verve and very real passion it has for native americans , despite the triteness of its story and the fact that it offered no new insights into child abuse , resolving the father-son relationship only posthumously .	1
what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood .that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to .works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there .	1
so the killing by pistol doesn't become the big issue , but the fact that jim has come out of the closet , that does not seem to be tolerated in savannah's high society or by the ordinary folks who will make-up the jury .the film then turns into a courtroom drama , and sonny seiler shines as the silky tongued , good ole country boy lawyer .yet , i still found enough good things in the film to say that it might not please everyone , but it did catch the proper atmosphere in savannah and provided an entertaining look at the people who dwell there .	1
what made it even more difficult , was that the story line was built around the murder case and not around the more interesting ideas generated by time travel .yet , it was this virtual reality computerized world that left me dazzled with its engrossing ideas .the 13th floor , directed by josef rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with ravel centeno-rodriguez can be valued for its re-creation of a 1937 los angeles of fancy bars , booming oil wells , and a magnificent wilshire boulevard setting .	1
this escapist movie is sponsored in part by sega , influenced in part by the death threat on indian author salmun rushdie , and it sure feels like a '60s bad acid trip ala video game that the twelve game players in the film are into .burroughs influenced cronenberg with the idea that what you create as an artist becomes a living thing , it goes out into the world and has a life of its own but is still connected to you .the main supporting cast includes willem dafoe as gas and ian holm as kiri .	1
what i learned right off the bat from this experimental documentary styled film about the director's search for his nazareth palestinian roots , is that in the holyland souvenir shop , the " holy water " comes from the tap and has a cross put on it to make it look authentic .the following events that took place in the film's first part give us some inkling about the character of the palestinians : we watch a bunch of old women chew the fat while peeling garlic .to use nazareth and jerusalem , two cities governed by israel , not the palestinians , and imply that this is palestine , is perhaps wishful thinking on the part of first time director elia suleiman .	1
a gorgeously filmed fable taking place in the steppes of southeastern iran , about the nomadic ghashghai tribe noted for the handicraft of their beautiful carpets .she appears like an attractive apparition sitting by the stream , where sometimes she is seen smiling sweetly and other times sadly reflecting the pains she feels in her tender heart , clad in a traditional dress , which is an ornate blue color that matches the carpet .i quite frankly don't understand all the cultural ramifications of the tale and what the exact meaning of its conclusion amounts to , but that didn't hinder me from being amazed by the stunningly lush landscapes seen and from enjoying the film as is .	1
homage is paid here to such classic movies as sunset boulevard and johnny guitar , as these are viewed on tv by the neurotics featured in the film , whose lives seem more unreal than what they are watching on screen .there were at least eight other little episodic dramas , other than the one just referred to- of the lady who wakes up in the morning , whose only aim in life is to watch films on tv for the whole day .the way the lives of these lonely new york city denizens are presented , make for an original film , though not a complete one , but one that is worth seeing for those who don't mind seeing something a bit different .	1
the thing here is history as mixed in with the loose telling of aeschylus' oresteia tragedies-- characters are even named orestes , electra , and chrysothemis .things certainly look glum ; the only cheer comes from the actors , as they are transported through the far-out regions of greece and sing their rhythmic songs of freedom , love , and sadness with a dignity and verve that enraptures the film in a very moving mood .the modern greek history of betrayal , revenge , and redemption are both the subtle and underlying themes of the story , as seen through the eyes of the weary acting troupe .	1
we just lost interest in the characters , the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't stop and get to the main article .so what could have been cutting edge dramatics , if the lesbian romance was followed through further , turns out to be a film not about art , but more of a soap opera story , about how three women , at different stages of their life , get together and separate .which left the film only somewhat satisfying ; it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters , and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart .	1
it reminded me somewhat of " picnic at hanging rock " , that film also effectively left the disappearance up to the imagination and did not dwell on the details of the children's demise .the flaws in this project are that it was like going on the trek yourself , walking over bumpy logs , getting wet , and feeling cold and uncomfortable , and listening to all those snidish remarks and whining that came out of the three .it was also hard on the ears to hear their conversations , both because of the poor sound quality and their endless ramblings , punctuated only by profanity .	1
barlach's grumpy demeanor , the strange circumstances of the case , and the unsettling swiss countryside , add a noir feel to this b & w film .martin ritt , who is usually a film director , plays his part with all the right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting .but the ending , when all the game plans come together , left me slightly irked-- this easy to watch film , just didn't add up .	1
gauff/paul gardner/eugene archer ; cinematographer : jean rabier ; cast : orson welles ( theo ) , anthony perkins ( charles ) , marlene jobert ( helene ) , michel piccoli ( professor ) , 1972-fr . )it is supported by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that will involve adultery , madness , blackmail , deception , jealousy , theology , and murder .but theo remains godlike , charming the public and buying them off with his wealth , making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side .	1
this is not the way the american dream is meant to be earned .it can only be attained by the honest means of hard work and fair play and through one's ability .kruger also has the best line in the film , when he tells chippy , " i admire loyalty , but not to the wrong people . "	1
this well-crafted mystery , is a first-rate summer entertainment vehicle , flaws and all--one large ( the story if examined carefully , especially leading up to its surprise discovery , would not hold up to careful scrutiny , it's all really hollywood hokum ) , one medium ( ghosts can't move physical objects around , this is pure hollywood invention ) , and one minor ( ghosts don't leave marks on one's body , though that was a ploy that added questions about parental abuse to the story , making it fit into a modern problem in society ) .haley's fright is convincing because he does not over emote the role but plays it as a child would who knows that adults don't like to hear things that are not understood by them .so he speaks in a low , almost hushed voice of haunting terror , adding punch and gravity to his hallucinations and ghost stories , making his frightful experience seem real .	1
what sparkles through the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast , who are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful and their story worth telling .eddie , as the central figure of the story , is probably the one who is the most out of it , either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what is real and what is false .as an interesting gesture to the media age of the 1980s , drazen uses the tv images we view from the channel-changing eddie , showing how meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen : tragedies , wars and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the media but all meld into insignificance in one's daily life , with no follow-up search for the truth in these stories taking place .	1
this is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in communist poland and a comedy , as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies .the power in the story was in the subtle reminders , showing that behind the obvious censorship , there is a real censorship problem for everyone , it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities-- but , for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved .and for showing that struggle through stuhr's eyes , the film is memorable , though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works , yet it is still worth seeing .	1
amelio's film is a political one , with a black comedic edge to it , as it traces the tragic recent history of albania , studying the dehumanizing effect bad governments have on its people .amelio ( open doors , stolen children ) has so much political ground to cover that the film becomes overwhelmed with the misery of its exploration and suffers because of it .problems such as immigration , poverty , corruption , cultural decadence , ignorance , hate , greed , and a generation influenced by italian television are just too complicated and heavy to handle without sacrificing something in the process .	1
it is allegedly based upon a true story , one that echoes the director's universal appeal for everyone to end all their hatred .if the film could be faulted , it is that everyone in it is used as a symbol , which takes away some of the spontaneity of their individualism , so the characters don't really stick with us as much as the arson of the villages does and all the other catastrophes that result from the war .this is a disturbing film , not one that is easy to watch , even as its gallows humor tries to lessen the somber tone of the story .	1
the dazzling cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of pittsburgh look like an inferno , while it switches gears and goes to the contrasting opulence of the vatican and the poverty of the brazil village , where the faithful flock to the miracle church .he is evil from- the beginning to the end- of the film , and how he ends up is just hollywood hokum , leaving me disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the cardinal look like a strangler .i just couldn't warm up to her sexy dumb hairdresser characterization , it seemed too funky and since she was the brunt of most of the special effects , it all seemed like an exorcist movie going on for too long , losing any rationality and prospective of what this film was supposed to be about .	1
there's something about mary is a very funny film ; it makes the most out of being politically incorrect , profane , obnoxious , and settling for an unsophististicated juvenile humor to tide itself over while the romantic side of its tale fizzles .it is funny because it is so grossly done that , at first , it is hard to believe how far this tasteless gag is going , but it is taken to the hilt , as the police and fire departments arrive and the neighborhood gets to see an unusual occurrence , it even ends with the showing of the wounded private part .this raunchy comedy , created by the farrelly brothers , who gave us dumb and dumber and kingpin , is a winner only for those who don't mind being grossed out .	1
a minor but most enjoyable tongue-in-cheek hitchcockian-like spy thriller from the michael powell & emeric pressburger team .the brisk pace of the film and its touches of quaintness , made the film seem very comically endearing inspite of the lack of any character study and the one-dimensional tone of the villains .the likable lovers , also , starred in powell's the spy in black .	1
it should be commended for its mesmerizing style and enormous strength it showed in sticking with an unpleasant subject most films do not usually cover .a prostitute not having sex with a client who requested it is hard story to forget so easily , as it seems , if done right , that could have been an innovative and moving scene and helped the film recover from being too bleak .the film got caught up too much in the tragedy of the twin's life and dwelt too much on the gravity of their situation without coming up with much more than heavy symbolism for its answers ( chopsticks broken in half , a two dollar bill as change in a cab and later on the subject of a lecture by the good doctor telling how if the bill is torn in half it is not worth as much as if it were whole ) .	1
this film is distinguished by oscar levant creating an opera for it called carnival and william kernell doing the libretto .the film had a convincing atmosphere and style about it , and it had the peerless boris doing his chilling loony thing with great relish .but let's forget the story , this film is fun in an old-fashioned way , and it's many pearls of wisdom that come forth , such as charlie explaining how a madman and a genius are sometimes similar because they both live in a world created by their ego .	1
we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots .that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to .when they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous neighborhood adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up , it all seems to be a tragically wasteful way of life .	1
my life so far is cute , it has an angelic glow to it ; it captures the gorgeous scenery of the argyll countryside and the mannerisms of the eccentric well-to-do pettigrew family .all the performances are first-rate , its storytelling and sense of drama are done in a classy manner , but it is a film that i quickly forgot about when leaving the theater , though i did have a smile on my face .and i say the following in a kindly manner , this is masterpiece theater stuff , appropriately filmed for the mature audience that should appreciate such a blithe period piece .	1
though , even in this type of traditional hollywood ending that has pleased movie goers of romantic films for generations now , the director has his doubts if there is any state of being that can be permanent .as for me , it wasn't the ending that bothered me about this breathlessly beautiful film , with its stunning shot of the midnight sun and of the arctic wildlands , as much as the story getting lost in trying to be too fanciful , playing with my expectations for things to work out for these amenable lovers and then not delivering any firm message but what seems to be at first glance , only , a pretentiously philosophical one .and , by not staying on target with the romantic part of the story , but drifting around in circles , where the coincidences are just too much for any two people to experience in a lifetime , the film becomes marginalized and makes it seem like a philosophy exercise , albeit an absorbing one , but one that is , nevertheless , less dramatic and more melodramatic than it should be .	1
this makes for a different type of documentary , one with a less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch , as the varied contestants of different ages , sizes , genders , and races , each have their idea on what it takes for them to win .some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews , were the one's whose personalities stood out , whom we saw at different hours and in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions .angie learns that she didn't prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes disorientated , saying she doesn't think she would ever do it again , but she comes back next year and wins .	1
( director : so begins a film that is more interested in studying the nature of someone who could commit such a crime and have it escalate to a murder than in keeping the film suspenseful by having the audience guess who did it . "this is the pivotal scene of this b/w noir film , as hopta goes completely over the edge and cannot be looked upon any more as just a pathetic loser who keeps making mistakes .what keeps the film chilling , is dan duryea as the friendly next-door neighbor , who is so psychologically warped , yet doesn't overtly show it .	1
jimenez ; cast : joe carnahan ( sid french ) , dan leis ( bob melba ) , ken rudulph ( f .it's a vintage pontiac le mans burgundy convertible that will soon be dropped off to them and they will be paid $250 , 000 if they allow it to sit on the lot for two days without trying to sell it or even touch it .a number of preposterous twists come about , as the film winds its way to its final payoff , where we see suitcases filled with money being exchanged , cocaine lined up in the trunk in plastic baggies , all sorts of high-powered guns exhibited , and mysterious packets of blood .	1
there should also be some nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation spots , for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when growing up or raising a family .the acting was convincing , the story had a nice feel to it , and it followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at that time .i thought that the fleeting affair she had with the long-haired sculptured adonis figure , certainly satisfied her sexual needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response , which left me believing that the liaison was the thing here , just like in those romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read , with nothing more to tax your mind .	1
the story has a certain charm to it and a genuineness that shows through in the telling of the story , as it moves seamlessly from comedy into suspense , at the drop of a briefcase .nick veronis makes his debut as actor/writer/director in this very refreshing story .the film offers many keen observations about how these young people react to the tight situation they are in , and it examines in an amusing way their life-style and esprit de corps , but the story keeps coming back to jimmy and how he is prepared to do anything to make his film , even if it means stepping on a few toes of some gangsters .	1
takeshi " beat " kitano is certainly a unique director , whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable , achieving auteur status .he has a fascination with gangsters , violence , and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way .though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner , that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage , and supposedly liking it and coming back for more , it still shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen .	1
the brilliant cinematography in this slasher thriller is what takes it out of the ordinary realm of such films and makes it into a diverting and more artistic venture .esteemed cult director , donald cammell ( performance/demon seed/the wild side ) , has never quite lived up to the potential he showed in the masterpiece he co-directed , " performance . "for a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a character study , this is , nevertheless , a well-crafted visual spectacle , featuring an array of beautifully stylized color co-ordinated scenes and out-of-the-way shots , that have little to do with the story , but overall they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film to a tee .	1
a very troubling film , regarding the crimes of martha beck and raymond fernandez , who were executed in 1951 .this film differs from the former in its more gaudy and cartoonish style and careful camerawork taking note of the reflecting light patterns that surrounded the couple , and with a penchant for showing the troubled characters gazing into mirrors , as if they were looking for their lost souls .as diabolical as this film was , in showing the couple to be moral degenerates with no conscience or redeeming qualities , the earlier film , the one i still prefer , takes a slightly different emphasis , holding a more cult-like look at the grotesque couple , while also showing them to be heartless weirdos without any redeeming qualities .	1
a melodramatic noir film , with location shots in the caribbean .why cormack doesn't leave , is what makes him a typical noir icon .	1
by this time the major and barbara show a strong affection for each other , and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding of hands taking place , though there is one scene where she comes out of the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the major's attention .what's viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking everybody they see , killing all the people manning the nuclear plant .there are great special effects , using stop-motion animation to show the brains moving around !	1
offbeat suspense story , with some romance thrown in , is a fast-moving crime caper , taking place mostly in a library .it's a spirited film , with enough cheap freudian explanations about the forger and his associate to keep you in stitches with its freudianisms .sanders's typical suave and maniacal performance , plus the b&w noir-like lighting for the film , give it a mysterious look , and the many twists in the plot and its unusual location , make it a better- than- usual b-movie .	1
the 81-year-old boris karloff's last completed feature film , could have and should have been better , as it suffers from a weakly-crafted script despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen favorites who are in it- that would be karloff as professor marshe , christopher lee as morley , and barbara steele as lavinia .but the professor replies in his noted serious karloff movie tone , " when the time comes , your skepticism might be only a fragile shield . "the film's not real frightening because there is a flatness to it ; but , it has its entertaining moments , and is a must see for karloff fans .	1
if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing , beautiful set designs , fantastic colors , sex , witchcraft , and a fairy tale charm to it , then you will probably like this film , which is in many ways like flying down to rio .but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment , this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at .the this is all done as harmless and silly fun , much in the vein of a long list of hollywood and french musicals , films that i was never partial to .	1
its strongest asset being the quick-witted and acidy dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to deliver those punch lines .in this scene we get a good dose of the ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they do .smith's film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the struggle it takes to make it work , but there is still an air of superficiality about its presentation .	1
i found tori's performance to be lacking in spunk , especially when compared to the fine ensemble cast she is surrounded by .if this kind of parody over the tragedy that rocked the country , upsets you , and you think it is in bad taste , then you shouldn't see this film .the real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an academic explanation for the parker character's obsession .	1
this film , based on carl sagan's novel , is a mixture of sci-fi , romance , sentimentality , and drama , brought to screen by the director of forreset gump .here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary aim-- that there is life in outer space .sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion , but i don't think he would have been to happy with the elementary-school theological debate between the space pioneer and the government officials .	1
it exhibits the kind of racist outlook shown to the natives that movies will not allow today .what distinguishes this film , is the virtuoso performance of chaney as a villain , as he transforms himself into a fearsome character , and his expressive face keeps changing with his different moods .the film is a strangely curious relic , not because of the story , but because he played this legless man so convincingly .	1
glam is the kind of music that is pretty to look at for short periods of time but when more closely scrutinized could turn ugly .bre , haynes throws a bit of the oscar wilde biography into the fiction presented .unfortunately , the film did not pick up on that thread of the story , as it continued on in its glitzy musical style .	1
there is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story , but the visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully explored in an original way , by the first-time director , manuel pradal .as i thought this film was about loners versus the group psychology prevailing , whereas the loners can't function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls can find no place in modern french society to fit in .after a certain point , that becomes an annoying feature of the film , as the two teens lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director was trying to say .	1
the problem with the film , as an original and diverting story as it is , is that it is also too confusing to follow and suffers from a sense that it is too " hip " for its own good .it was shot in such exacting detail , its colorful sets becoming a feast for the eyes that were ready to experience visions not seen in other sci-fi films , it also allowed for a certain pleasure to be induced from overhearing the odd conversations that were inane but fun to listen to .fox's haiku is a good example of the meaningful nonsense the film conveyed , as he recites to x the poem he just wrote : but something mysterious soon happens and the last 20 minutes of the film repeats what happened so far , but adding new details and a different way of looking at it .	1
sitko's classical noir line to him is , " you going legitimate is like a vulture turning vegetarian . "fake niceties are not allowed in this highly charged atmospheric b&w film .the ones who imbue the film with its usual noir credentials are the heavies : burr , whose only thought about being involved with murder was , " i should have stuck to blackmail and petty larceny . "	1
these scenes between the cops and the hysterical youth are classic noir ones and are what give the film its very dark edge .this was a dark tale and could have been made more interesting if it cut away from father roth's saintly but unconvincing role and followed through more on the story as it was written by philip yordan from leo brady's novel .censorship was the curse of the 1950s for films , and this good priest-bad priest part of the story unfortunately turns out to be an exercise in self-righteousness , unwisely tacked onto a perfectly good story .	1
the film was faithfully adapted from the novel of british author , eric ambler , and had more of a european feel to it than the ordinary american noir , though because of the dark lighting and the shadowy photography of renown film cinematographer arthur edeson- he also did " the maltese falcon , " the film was able to retain its noir credentials despite lacking the usual cynicism of noir .rich flavor in the film comes from the lead character actors , who are indescribably witty and tacky , displaying good chemistry in working with each other , whose characterizations are most striking .they , along with the strong performance by scott , give this pleasant thriller the life it needs to sustain it .	1
this is seen mainly through the dark los angeles settings depicted by the camerawork of probably the best noir cinematographer ever , john alton , and not through the thin plot structure of the film .what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer , is the warehouse shootout , as we see these antisocial types trapped like rats and how they react .it all seems credible because john payne has the look of someone who has just come out of a laundry washing machine and is now being hung out to dry .	1
a vulgar mockumentary about a jewish-italian wedding , whose detractions are that some of the scenes could have been better edited , the jokes being rather lame , and the script being too threadbare .there is profanity used throughout the film and at the most surprising times , like when the groom's father ( vella ) is giving a toast .lisa has a great smile and a star quality about her , she brings comedy and warmth to the role ; she even gets a chance to sing .	1
jacques demy , the subject of this biography , was a great filmmaker ; his films were poetical visions , filled with music and fantasy and magic .but for all the niceties about him shown , and deservedly so , this biography seemed somewhat sterile and unwilling to question a lot of personal things about demy's life .the film seems as if it was a guided museum tour given to elementary school children , that will only show the director's dedication to being a filmmaker and will reveal nothing about what is inside the man .	1
julianne moore evoked a special passion to her role , she was able to mix the fire in her with the serenity , making her performance a sublime one .the problem with that , is the film seemed to move at a snail's pace , and had too much of a vacuum between its intellectual messages and heavily passionate scenes .though what's astonishing about jordan's direction , is the mood the film sets , being so nostalgic and intimidating , as if daring the viewer to believe that this old-fashioned kind of genteel love story could also be so daring in its passions , and challenging in its arguments about jealousy , carnal love , and religious faith .	1
brooks's novel broached the subject of a civilian getting killed by a soldier because he was a homosexual , but the breen office that acted as a censor for hollywood , would never allow that topic .so the filmmakers made the bias crime to be against a jew , which also was a subject hollywood tried to avoid , but , perhaps , because of the holocaust , it was allowed to be presented onscreen by the censor .even though the filmmakers were forced by the breen office to bend over backwards to make their film a safe one , it still was able to show the bias present in america and how serious a problem it was .	1
the film is not a touristy tale ; it is based on irish folklore .rea is equally as good , in a role that is a take-off on the frenetic crazie eddie character who years ago was seen hawking goods on american tv .it is worth seeing for the tremendous performances and a bit of the gritty local flavor not usually seen about a film emanating from ireland .	1
it is a familiar story , but told with great charm here and with sharp observations of how these academia types talk to each other and interact .the script is snappy , the actors are pleasing to behold , the photography , mostly shots of pittsburgh in the midst of snow or a torrential downpour , is bleak-- but it interestingly sets the tone for the film's playful story .this does not make it a great film , but it was diverting and had a certain sophistication to it that should attract an older audience , one more perceptive about the advantages of a higher education .	1
the violent conclusion is done with style and adds to the comic mood the film set .it is a rather cheerful film-- despite the violence , the lowlife characters , and all the peat bogs the duo come across .its ethics are blurred by what society considers right and wrong , but by going over that line of decency , the film gains most of its charm .	1
but spike is not that concerned with the serial killer , his perspective of the event is how it influenced an italian bronx neighborhood , bringing out its paranoia .it was at times a film that bordered on greatness , but then for long stretches turned back into a mess , filled with untenable stereotypes of the italians , while losing track of its story about the psycho .leguizamo's performance is special in a visceral way , it exposes his double-standard life and his lowlife mindset , his rage is what the film keys in on .	1
the charles dickens influence is evident on griffith's work , as the complications to this simple plot keeps getting more involved in the political trials of the revolutionary times .but somehow the well-intentioned sincerity of the story plows its way through the mess and the film is interesting as both a museum curio and for the raw emotions expressed by the suffering sisters .the excessively melodramatic story is one that tugs at the heart strings , but makes up for so much goo by conveying griffith's history lesson : that the french revolutionists rightly overthrew a bad government , but unfortunately allowed dictatorial mob rule to take over .	1
if only the telling of the story wasn't such a clumsy venture and the identity of the killer so easy to solve , this could have been a more enjoyable film .sean connery is charismatic and though an odd choice to play the lead , if you can suspend your disbelief in him as a book lover to the extreme , and see him more like a modern sleuth , then his characterization seems to be a humorous one .but the weakness inherent in the film , is in the dullness of the characters ( looks aside ) and the story itself is bereft of the wit the author gave it in its printed word .	1
and because they are so dull-witted and deliver lines without the gift of gab that a writer like david mamet presents his stars with , in his glengarry glen ross , the film lags in scope .the characters here are just low-level white collar hustlers , the amoral garden variety kind , and their distasteful conduct and empty lives spark no interest .the movie has a lot of energy and zeroes in on an unhealthy segment of the population whose lure for working is solely for material things , such as fancy cars , not giving a hoot how ethical their job is .	1
it did ruin the film to a certain extent , as it looked disjointed in parts and did not appear up to fuller's usually high standards of filmmaking .nevertheless , it resulted in a disturbing film about american morality that has something to say about hypocrisy and something modern to say about being an independent woman .the couple talk about byron's poetry and about venice being a special place for lovers , and everything seems too good to be true .	1
but that aside , this is a very funny crime caper , involving double-crosses , kidnappings , and outrageous shootouts .kyra sedgwick works well with tucci and significantly adds to the farcical nature of the film .philip seymour hoffman never gives a bad performance ; here he is the creepy turncoat , a part he can do in his sleep by now .	1
shattered image has its two stars struggle through some very awkward dialogue and plot twists that keep coming unmercifully at the viewer .ruiz's experimental film style opts for the most he can get out of his stylized settings , confusing but beautiful camera shots , and all the kitsch he can muster in every mise-en-sc ?if you enjoy this kind of pseudo intellectual puzzler , then you must be prepared to be kept in suspense , not knowing more about the character than what ruiz wanted revealed .	1
but , the subtle performance by the rumpled looking finney , playing second fiddle without a hint of a complaint , as his panned reactions to her antics made her star quality shine more brightly , was the key to the film's success .it plays pompously proud of itself like the do-gooder fare it is , with no real emotions shown for the victims , as it only shows the pain julia feels for them .where i saw the film , the same type of working-class clients of julia's , were in the audience and were laughing lustily at the jokes , and they seemed to enjoy seeing this big company being taking on by one of them .	1
when don pedro agrees , serafin tells the audience that i am macoco .there are several surprises in the works and an outstanding dance number by the nicholas brothers .this highly entertaining film overcomes its stagy plot with some lively cole porter tunes , gorgeous costumes and scenery design , and a lot of energy from the talented cast .	1
you have to remember that this film was made in the radicalized 1960s and that reason for robbing a bank might have been accepted back then in some circles of thinking .the film also offered an oscar winning song scored by michael legrand , windmills of your mind , and some fancy camera work of split-screen images by cinematographer haskell wexler .it turns out to be an easily forgettable caper movie that was pleasing on the eyes as much as easy on the noodle .	1
dennis schwartz : " ozus' world movie reviews "	1
the director is clearly more concerned with artful flourishes , elizabeth's lustfulness , and the modern ways to look upon a queen trying to be a ruler of men , rather than exploring further the tragic and specific drama of the times .this one's primarily a costume piece melodrama that enjoyably emphasizes the conspiracies surrounding the so-called virgin queen , who is destined to rule england's golden age for some 40 years .cate blanchett becomes elizabeth , giving her a modern feminist voice and a dark look inside her soul , in a daring performance that works out rather well , considering the film was emotionally flat and uninvolving .	1
a real-life chilling tale of matricide is put forth in a complex build-up of an obsessive and passionate relationship between two very imaginative adolescent girls , set in christchurch , new zealand , between 1953 and 1954 .by tossing fantasy and reality together in such a haphazard manner , it creates a world of disturbing visions , one in which the film holds the viewer's interest throughout .the film is also visually stunning , but the moral of the story is never made clear and there is bit too much pretentious fantasy art thrown into the script .	1
reese witherspoon's performance was contagious , watching her cut-up , act-tough , be vulnerable , and drop comic lines with a natural ease , and all the time , the film had the feel of being noir , even though it was really satire .freeway has the look of a crazed fable , as bulky onscreen figures are made to look less imposing at each impending scene and the vulnerable ones either die or get stronger just by surviving amidst such violent chaos .the film's sordid family scenario , leaves its sensationalized news stories mockingly imprinted on the airwaves , depicting how sad life is and how cartoon-like are the players , left to their own vanities , frolicking in an artificial landscape of alienation and violent gestures .	1
following on the heels of " the exorcist " , " the omen " is another box-office success , one of many commercial horror thrillers spawned in the 1970s , and much better critically than most others .what makes this film so captivating , is how it relies on narrative and not special effects to build on tension .all this leaves the ambassador befuddled , looking only as gregory peck can look , when things that are supposed to make sense don't .	1
but , it changes in a drastically different direction , and the surprises in the plot , from here on , come about faster than a venice beach skateboarder trying to impress the bystanders .i felt used by the characterizations , as it took away a lot of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of the storyline , that in the first act , worked really well .too many contrivances made everything seem so superficial , which is a shame , because the film did have its funny moments .	1
it's a pleasant little film , with its small aims hitting its target repeatedly , quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster must go through in order to grow up , and how the bland 1950s and its omens of the future in space travel , new pop-up toasters , and a tv in every house , influence the youngster's life .by being very easy to talk to , with no pretenses , he thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and makes his summer experience a joyous one .the scenes of the snow on the tv screen while all the neighbors are brought in to watch a movie , the radio broadcast of the swedish boxer ingemar johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the american champ floyd patterson , and the challenging games kids play to compete against each other , all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the 1950s .	1
john adair ( sheridan ) is one of the actors who pushes her on-stage to get the part and he becomes her boyfriend , in a story that left me feeling unmoved , as it was just typical hollywood goo , seen many times before .vanessa redgrave , in a stereotyped role , is gray's lightheaded , titled wife , countess la grange , with liberal aspirations and sympathy for the theater people .i imagine that someone with much more political savvy and more experience directing than robbins , like mike leigh , could have found a way to get around this mess without altering where the sympathies should lie to pull off a more satisfying work .	1
greenwald's penchant for long close-ups of her disgruntled players , creates a noir feel for the film .she also adds strength to the noir style of the film , by having the dialogue stripped to the bare minimum .the film failed to be a nail-biter and it wasn't psychologically deep , nor was it morally arresting , but what it had going for it in spades , was showing a feeling of malaise .	1
the action scenes of the eventual show-down between the rivals , makes for exciting cinema .as for submarine type action films , this one as for human drama far outweighs the recently released u-571 , and also for authenticity , acting , and suspense .the only thing the newer version has over this submarine flick , is that it makes good use of how far the technology has come , as its digital special effects take full-advantage of that .	1
here's one spectactle of a film ridley scott definetly made for the masses , a large-budgeted ( somewhere over 100 million bucks ) digital effects epic , a star wars film for grown-ups , with the intention to overwhelm you with its technical feats and please your senses with its photography and dazzle you with the roman colosseum gladiator events , and most of all , it tries to breathe new life into the much maligned and parodied heroic tale .general maximus commands his troops to `unleash hell' on their underdog adversaries with an outpouring of arrows and flaming canisters to fill the screen with blood and gore and mud , and a beautifully framed picture of the barbarians' woods on fire and its landscape turned into an eerie hue of bluish-gray ash .scott succeeds in his visceral opening just like spielberg did in saving private ryan , of grabbing the audience's attention and keeping it for most of the film .	1
a crisp james cagney comedy vehicle , at a time when the 34-year-old actor was at the peak of his stardom .a breezy feature , showing cagney in his true light during the depression era of escapist films .it was in films like this one that gave his audience hope things no matter how ridiculous they seemed for them , could get better .	1
a noble idea for a film to satire some of the best known american pop culture heroes of the 1950s , as directed by the britisher nicolas roeg , from a terry johnson play conceived in 1982 .marilyn is the life of the film , presenting a sexy and engaging sex goddess , who is both vulnerable and pushy .but as a diverting look at these fantasies of the four 1950 icons , it makes for provocative theater and in the process , it sometimes offers us some inspired thoughts to think about .	1
the film's strong suit is watching the precision planning that goes into the operation as it unfolds and how all these older blokes exhibit their odd personalties to mesh into a team-operation replete with proper military decorum .a very watchable caper movie , but with a decided british edge to it which might inhibit some american viewers from enjoying it as much .the lovable rogue characters give the film a spirited uplift , with hawkins , patrick , livesey , and attenborough being particularly good in their portrayals .	1
at the 1996 cannes film festival , where it got mixed reviews of boos and cheers from the crowd , it nevertheless received a special jury prize for " originality . "the film has something to say that comes in the form of a veiled warning about the future of technology and the potential deepening psychopathology that is needed for a more benevolent humanity .it has caused ripples of controversy , not because of any theme it might have , but because of the sex scenes in the cars , its crossing of old moral boundaries in favor of pornography , and the way the film unfolds without a visible story .	1
this kid is certainly not a hardened criminal , which is the shame of it all , as there seems to be no answers from society or from this film what to do about lost souls like him .at least , the film makes clear that its position is that incarceration is not the answer , which certainly goes against the current grain of thinking in america .it could have used something else to compensate for the mindlessness of ryan to go along with his painful tale of hopelessness and the film's evocative atmosphere , which wears thin after awhile .	1
this film can be loosely pegged as a noir film , though it plays more like a typical 1950s caper movie .this minor slip-up , is why in a loose way , mike becomes a noir protagonist , though he doesn't have the dark side to his character this genre usually calls for .i think if the filmmaker reworked some of the loose ends left hanging in this film , there would have been a much stronger film to complement the very strong characterization of the earnest barry sullivan character the filmmaker was able to present .	1
though the director tries to present some of the establishments' arguments against these young dissenters to show that he is impartial , the weight of what is going down is so heavy , that even when the tribunal members make a plausible response , it still sounds vacuous given the current situation .the film had a gritty look to it and should bring back some of the worst confrontational memories of a time the country was divided in a very hostile way .to add to that the fictional suspension of individual rights and a horror chamber like punishment park , makes this film seem like a futile diatribe that lost its prospective of what its aim was .	1
soren kragh-jacobsen's " mifune " is dogma's third approved project , after vinterberg's " celebration " and von trier's " idiots . "it is , nevertheless , a surprisingly conventional work , which makes me wonder about all the fuss this dogma 95 group go through to give the impression that they are radical filmmakers .what worked well in this film , was that the actors had personality that flashed on the screen , and that there were some breathtaking nature shots of the golden sun going down and of the rich colors of the danish backwater fields .	1
the innovative canadian of armenian descent , atom egoyan , who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does here , revisits the themes of betrayal , familial ills , religious conflicts , sexual secrets , videotapes , and uncertain identities .bob hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered , even if he chews the scenery to gain such control , but , nevertheless , he is engaging as a manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and frightening .what fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production , is that everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end .	1
though the plot of the film revisits familiar territory , of the rescue of the princess tale , and the idea of a buddy movie , where characters who are opposites must mesh together .what results are well-executed pratfalls , lots of sight gags , ingenuous fight scenes , some stupid ethnic jokes and the flaunting of indian stereotypes , but whereas those old westerns had the bias be for real , here's its in jest and , all the while , the film keeps the comedy rolling on .though not all the comedy works , the scenes of owen in the whorehouse were stale and offered the lowest kind of vulgarian humor .	1
a sometimes funny parody and uncanny black comedy , about incest , sexual repression , and the jewish mob .but its failure to be consistently on focus with its characters' comings and goings , in what seems like a pointless amount of gore being displayed , acts to undermine the film's artful plot set-up .as the film is too often off target , bringing up too many subjects for it to handle , it just fires away , taking aim at everything in its way and missing just as often as it hits .	1
small time crooks is a small time comedy , nourished by getting a fast start off the gate with some pretty familiar comedy routines -- it starts off paying homage to the italian film " big deal on madonna street , " but it is not able to sustain that homage or carry on with the fast-paced comedy hi-jinks after the first half hour , and what's worst , it falls into a predictable way of telling the story , which ends the film on a rather pedestrian note .he seems to have given up being an artistic filmmaker ( i doubt if he ever was committed to being one , but he did like ingmar bergman's " wild strawberries , " and at one time attempted to make bergman-quality films ) .he is banking on the audience cravings for a few of his patented one-liners to give them a comedy fix until his next predictable work .	1
the older b&w version puts less stress on the lust and more on the inner conflict the two lovers are having .this version actually leaves a greater impact on the viewer of the momentous tragedy of the self-imposed restrictions religion has placed on the relationship for her .the best performances in the film came from the two actors who seemed to be effortlessly acting , john mills , as the detective interested more in the craft of his job than the ethics , though always aware of the moral implications of what he is doing .	1
mankiewicz does a nice job of creating the dark noir mood .the film is laden with comedy , excellent performances , plenty of suspense , plus a voice-over by john ireland , and it manages to keep the pot boiling with a quintessential amnesiac story .	1
the only thing different about this one , is that it is consciously played for laughs , which gets it through its cartoonish lowbrow humor , as it features characters who all have something about them that is dysfunctional : they are illiterate , have a depraved mental condition , suffer from greed , or just like to kill people .there is nothing that we haven't seen before in such road films , from a vintage car convertible to a gun fetish to white trash humor , and finally to random violence , but there is a surprise ending here involving , what else , but , betrayal for the gold .the characters all had personality , and the force of the movie overall , had a desirable effect , even if it is an easy film to forget and requires as little thinking as possible when viewing .	1
the framework of the story is the same formula seen in almost every hollywood sports film , as the art of dancing is only paid lip service to .the best reason for seeing the film , is that the dancing is alive and pulsating , choreographed by the likes of balanchine , susan stroman and christopher wheeldon , as well as ivanov and macmillan .in center stage , there was plenty of dancing at rehearsals and in the two big ballet numbers they put on , before the film comes to its predictable climax for its soap opera stories .	1
this steven zaillian directed film has traces of the same intelligence he has shown in his previous work as director of searching for bobby fischer and as a screenwriter for schindler's list , but loses its fire-power with scenes of endless court hagglings and what seems like an interminable amount of time spent in giving prep classes on how the court system works .the supporting players all have limited roles compared to the two gunslingers , travolta and duvall , but perform admirably .though they were sympathetic to the families' plight and caught the essence of what travolta was up against , which makes it better than most hollywood films , it just couldn't drive the fastball thrown down the middle of the plate over the 'green monster' in fenway park for a home run .	1
aldrich for the most part steers clear of the political situation in the country , instead he uses these men as powerful mythic symbols , showing the oppressed versus the oppressor .if the kid could just shut up and be grateful that he is learning how to be a hobo from the king , marvin could have warmed up to him a little .it's just too bad that the director couldn't connect all the dots with the corrupt political situation that caused this great suffering and left so many with hardened hearts .	1
the film is more interesting when viewed from the angle of mark's personal life and where he's currently at than from him making an ed wood jr .mark is indomitable in his pursuit of his dream and chris smith has done a fine job of editing the film and nailing down his subject as accurately as he could , so that the dark side is balanced with the rosy picture mark paints for himself .all this film did was make him a laughing stock instead of the audience discovering someone with a talent for comedy .	1
how she handles the few dramatic moments of her life , right before her high school graduation , is what makes this a very french film .che portrayal , that gets the most out of the terse dialogue and slim story , as she manages to look alluring in many different poses and who through her vitality and cynicism , always gives off a sense of hope that she will survive , no matter the situation .a female version of a camus hero or a rimbaud protagonist .	1
larry cohen's auspicious debut film is a scathing black comedy set in beverly hills .there were too many flat spots between the mesmerizing opening scene around the swimming pool and the bleak finale in a sand dune , to make this quirky effort work entirely .bone is a film desperately trying to get under one's skin , but doesn't have enough staying power to complete the job , except it leaves one with a lingering feeling of being unduly provoked and still laughing about it .	1
zhang yuan confines the film to the two actors stuck in the police station and it is only via flashback that we get to see a-lan's life unfold .even though it is a stagy film , the drama remains intense , as the explosiveness between the two keeps one glued to the final outcome , wondering how this odd relationship will work itself out .the gray-green and amber background of the park and the shadowy black shades of the public toilets , give the film a somber look .	1
at one point the sweet talking miriam declares , " mother , auntie kathy , a girl at swimming--and eunice , those are all the people who have kissed me . "but judy might also be viewed as a figment of her warped mind , or perhaps she represents someone from the bible , like the avenger named judith who beheaded an enemy of the israelites .the depravity and depth of alienation she evokes from her character , and the energy that amanda plummer puts into her characterization , make this a fascinating film , if you can ever get past the bleakness of the story .	1
a splendid tv movie remake of fritz lang's 1941 man hunt .clive donner makes o'toole grow into a character that is larger than his country , playing off his petulance , his wit and charm , against his daring skills to look death in the eye and heroically escape his pursuers .even though o'toole is the one trapped in the hole , the major seems to be the one suffocating on the truth , even as he puts on an air of decorum and lays it into his captive , his talk just sounds like jabbering when compared to o'toole's .	1
it is directed by wolfgang petersen , the german director of " das boot , " the best submarine picture ever made .but it is the only glimmer of intelligent dialogue that appeared to be taking place in the last 45-minutes , ever since the giant waves crested against the boat and the men could only be seen in the dark with their yellow slickers .i think the public will accept the grim outcome and relish viewing the storm and the terrible damage it causes , because it is the kind of action film they will want to see this summer , while they munch on some popcorn in an air-conditioned theater .	1
it was mildly entertaining , setting a wiseguy mood in a wealthy suburban area instead of using the usual locale of the gritty urban streets .but the film had such a pat look to it , i just couldn't help feel that it was phony , an annual staging of a movie about wannabe mafia youths that seems to be the dream-baby of almost every new indie director .the 26-year-old first-time director rob weiss , has this low-budget film put all its cards on the action table , moving it along at a fast clip .	1
he sets a dark mood of the los angeles scenario , escalating the dramatics with shadowy building shots .the noir theme of alienation is richly furnished , but the film had too many scenes that stretched too far afield in disbelief for it to have the necessary flow in it to sustain the tension .stanwyck was just too strong a character to be so completely victimized , so the film became more symbolic than a real flesh and blood story .	1
apparently , the judicial system has broken down , so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders .the convicts looked scary , the prison looked real , and the feeling of despair was the only air that was present , as rehabilitation seemed to be a farce , a show that one puts on to score clemency points from the judges .the film does a very good job in bringing this out and creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances .	1
a taut suspense yarn in b&w , that plays like noir because of all the eerie shadows on the wall and the conviction for murder of an innocent man .the melodramatic script was often not believable and the action part of the story looked like pretend acting , just like the therapy nancy davis was applying to gigi .gigi perreau was marvelous , giving a convincing performance as a little girl who could be both adorable and then almost frightened out of her mind .	1
" layin' low " is a charming comedy set in the brooklyn of the 1980s and laden with plenty of colorful city types .the ensemble cast does a nice job in sketching city life for a bunch of idlers .it's a sweet , little mellow story , with a lot of laughs in it , and with some violent scenes which never seemed real , more like play-acting .	1
a good old-fashioned mystery yarn , from john dickson carr , but this time instead of the lady vanishes , it is the husband who does .the story itself , if examined closely had many improbabilities , but the strength of the film is in the tension it creates within crain and how she handles it .crain seemed so helplessly alone , highlighted by showing her sitting by herself at the dining table and feeling that she is losing her mind , that set the mood for the entire film and her vulnarability is what the viewer identifies with .	1
this film has a gentle way of showing the war between the bureaucrats of big business and the little man caught in the squeeze of downsizing for greater company profits .how effective the film was , depended on how much you thought hopkin's change mattered .the film will keep track of how the likable but goofy carey does in the romance department .	1
there are a lot of good natured jokes about aging and some friendly ribbing between the young astronauts and the veterans , and it all seems pleasantly entertaining , though somewhat staged .but through the wonderful special effects and the full cooperation of nasa as consultants , there was a sense of awe in seeing the sights of space travel .and , when clint is able to make an impossible landing , something hollywood films are good at doing , there is a sense of relief that the old timer , who now has a lined and craggy face and looks like an american icon , is safe and sound .	1
the other evident influences on the greek filmmaker are bergman's somber look at family life and antonioni's picturesque and quirky photography .but the story seems too symbolic and arty to make a direct impact , every thought , no matter how banal , has to be philosophically scrutinized , which becomes unnerving .the 66-year-old director has made an accessible film despite its ambiguity , but it was lacking fluidity in its overstated symbolism and its idiosyncratic statement was not that deep for all its huffing and puffing , and pouring out of philosophical thoughts .	1
this early tragedy written by the young bard is also his weakest and most turbulent play , casting out dramatical dimensions , poetry , and pity in favor of gore .cumming's plays his role as an insecure , campy effete , prancing about as a puff , coifed in an adolph hitler hairstyle , as he aims to steal every scene by his gyrations and petulant looks .julie taymor's version was a good costumed effort to show the violence for all that it is , but in the process making it into a campy grand guignol production .	1
what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another .it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country .what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money .	1
when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped .the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg .you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault .	1
the intense acting and the quirky dialogue , plus the numerous plot twists and the penetrating character study enable the film to be entertaining in a nuanced way .it is also interesting to note that the film pays homage to great mystery writers such as graham greene , ernest hemingway , and malcolm lowry .it is believable that he ran away from regular life--that he just wanted to test himself , which is the gloomy beauty of the story , giving it its kafkaesque feel .	1
when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped .the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg .you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault .	1
what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another .it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country .what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money .	1
the director is ultimately asking the viewer to be the judge , as he seems too preoccupied with painting his canvas with a love that gets stuck somewhere between a lustful sexual romp and one of pathos .what results in an incomplete ending for a film that can't stand clarity except in its photography and its affection for the three flawed main characters ( alice , martin , and benjamin ) .the actors were all sweating their lines to make it seem as if they had to dig deep to come up with a gem here and there , but their performances were all finely tuned and seemed to add to the film's need to have confusion be its guiding light .	1
a very entertaining kitsch film , with great costumes , a fine sense of adventure , and an ample sprinkling of comedy .the sets are lavish and fun to look at ; the bouncy acting fits the playfulness of the fantasy story .the mix-ups are devilishly funny , and how the film gets resolved is fun to watch , as there are magic tricks that are performed and songs that are so bad that they are good , and a host of cast members come in and out of the film so seamlessly , adding their stamp of delightful bemusement to a very diverting film , which seems to be effortlessly done .	1
but there are scenes that are fresh and invigorating , filled with a deadly explosiveness , but somehow the film fails to put it all together to get at what it is trying to unearth from all the gunplay .armed with a highly polished script , lots of arty gunfights , and a convoluted , labyrinth story line , more interested in double-crosses and twists in the plot than human feelings , the film turned off on too many dead-ends to fulfill its potential .a film that has future cult popularity written all over its ambivalent signature , as the violence had an unsettling nature to it that will probably grow on art-house viewers of thrillers who will catch it on video .	1
the set is bristling with problems and tension .while the topical story is about the business and cynicism involved in making a picture , and the vanity of those in the field , its deeper concern is with understanding the personal nature of failure , insecurity , and disappointment .the film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of the intelligent discretion of minnelli in his directing and the fine acting from the two male leads , with robinson's performance being nothing short of brilliant , enough to lift this film on his shoulders alone to a loftier dimension .	1
their love affair which emerges unexpectantly , is unsettling to both of them , but real feelings develop on both sides , to the surprise of each , and how they resolve it , is what gives this film its bit of magic .these scenes were too predictable and offered no real insight into that underground world of prostitution , leaving many dry spells in the thin story line .jane fonda did get into the head of an intelligent call-girl who is searching for answers to her life , enough so she won a best actress oscar for her performance , though i thought she was at times shrill and played the role with too much of a calculated effort .	1
this film is a tale of adventure , romance , and intrigue , with a good deal of tongue-in-cheek comedy thrown in to help the predictable story out .this , his penultimate film , is a good example of how his mannered acting and striking latin looks , made him a ladies favorite .it is a large-scale picture , giving him a chance to do both action and romantic scenes , the kind of serious acting he wasn't asked to do in his previous films .	1
it's mired in the lightweight class , working as an effective film mostly because it has a sense of humor and travolta is convincing as the unlikely hero fighting against political corruption .the running gag is that he needs a perfect scream for his current film , a psycho-like one , with a shower slashing scene , and the actresses auditioned can't give a realistic one .de palma has moved solidly into mundane territory , jettisoning ideas in favor of high-tech shots and thrilling action scenes . "	1
the moody atmospheric film moves at a snail's pace , giving me the impression that it is about to say something important , but everything turns out to lead forlornly down a dead-end .the film goes out of its way to show how alienated and isolated the main characters are : mavi and niccolo are driving in a fog that is so thick one can't see anything , as they get lost for awhile while walking on the highway ; there are countless shots of doors opening and closing and of serious people talking to each other but not communicating .the nugget i found , is that the director is suggesting that in this " age of alienation , " it is more fun and realistic to make a childlike fantasy film than an idealized love story .	1
she is also seen in a bold light offering her impulsive opinions about anything , which sometimes are so blunt that they hit the mark , whereas a more educated person might not have been able to say what she did in such an offhand manner and gotten away with it .this film closely resembles what a free-spirited college student could do on a videocam , though here every scene looks beautifully shot and all the improvisationals have an air of professionalism about them .the film is loose and brash , filled with youthful exuberance and energy ; it constantly introduces peripheral characters , such as neighbors , relatives , and casual acquaintances , into the story , who add a cartoonish flavor to it .	1
this film is a captivating love it or hate it musical melodrama , one that should divide its audience to either pole , that unfairly pulls cards out of its sleeve to make sure its case against the death penalty can't lose .the story's heroine is played by icelandic pop singer-composer bjork , who won the best actress prize at the recent cannes film festival , with childlike simplicity and unbelievable dumbness on her part , allowing her character to lack depth .billy wilder in his " double indemnity " didn't have to use the electric chair to get across his point about how the justice system operates , neither was it used by tay garnett in his superior 1946 " the postman always rings twice . "	1
there is some additional hokum about the new person becoming a cannibal , if his brain does not heal properly after the operation .this theme is what sustains the b- film with a deeper meaning to the frankenstein myth and keeps him from being a one-dimensional villain .yet it was entertaining and the cast did a good job , all things considered .	1
stone keeps the terse story tense despite the almost certain proof the murder suspect is indeed the guilty one , but he leaves open that it is not absolutely certain until the climactic scene .this is a well-acted thriller and it is directed with some nice touches , as when cotten is romancing her on the deck and a door opens to a burst of laughter from some ship party goers .at that point the air went out of cotten , as he thought maybe it wasn't murder , but the druggist made an honest mistake , after all these kind of accidents happen all the time .	1
he is burdened with an unbelievable melodramatic story and the dullish performance of his femme fatale co-star , faith domergue , as the alluring margo lannington , two obstacles that are difficult to overcome .it was beautifully photographed by nick musuraca in the dark b&w style of noir and so ably directed by john farrow , who successfully caught the nightmarish visions of the tale .claude rains as always is magnificent , in a small part but one where his every gesture seems to be constrained in a maniacal rage ready to burst open .	1
this tearjerker melodrama proved to be a big hit commercially for the popular silent star mary pickford .though , by having pickford , " america's sweetheart , " commit a murder , its ethics and reasons for doing so can certainly be questioned , though the happy ending satisfied the public .though the film was as heavy as goo , it was not without some passing interest for mainly historical reasons .	1
a rehashed formula action/sci-fi film about the near future that looks old hat and plays like low-brow entertainment even as it advances the sophisticated problems cloning might eventually hold .he's the most interesting one in the film , so it behooves me that he has a truncated part , which fails to give him the depth needed to draw out his character and go further than the drab figure he is portrayed as , being a good scientist used by an evil businessman . "the joke being , that you don't have to die , the corporation can clone you in no time at all ( hardly believable ) , if they have your genetic code , and the cost is a only mere one and a half million bucks .	1
but lugosi couldn't pull it off being a surgeon and ends up in a minor part as the gangster marnay .the gangster red cannon sustains paralysing spinal injuries and is taken to the same hospital as kingsley . "the results are a mixed bag , but there's enough entertainment to be gotten from this b-film , to make it a satisfying watch .	1
an above-par courtroom drama , set in los angeles , elevated by director/screenwriter clifford odets' sharp script .it was also elevated by an outstanding cast , with special kudos to rita hayworth's warm portrayal of a woman in an abusive marriage and by sanford meisner's forceful and expressive performance as the cross-examing prosecutor .the story itself wasn't too interesting , but the performances were energetic and the film had a good courtroom style , enough to make this chatty film well worth seeing .	1
the heart of the film and indeed what keeps it lively , is watching carrey go through his repertoire in a flawless comic manner .milos forman's uneven film is missing the true craziness of kaufman in the entirety of the story .kaufman seemed to always be searching for something , whether in studying transcendental meditation , looking for a psychic cure for cancer in the philippines , or a way to push the limits of comedy to a further degree , and what we see in the film , is that he never quite found what he was looking for , in a career that was far too short for a man of his energies and stated talents .	1
a quintessential noir film , more entertaining and atmospheric than essential viewing , featuring a hard-boiled story , average though it may be , which goes beyond the main character getting killed in the first reel to spend the rest of the film examining why he lost interest in living anymore .and swede , while lying in bed in a darkened room replies , " i did something wrong .the film is more or less a pessimistic reaction to the post-war period and of the greed and lust that blinded those who typify the kind of characters who dwell in the noir world , a place where corruption is the norm .	1
a depiction of hell , resulting in a messy , sweeping political picture set in 1995 , where all the action takes place on a 12 degree winter night in belgrade , showing a breakdown in 'law and order . 'it was brutal to watch , more intense and more in your face than more recent films on serbia , one that had no subtlety or artistic edge , as the gruesome little scenes ran together in a heavy-handed manner and no voice of reason emerged , or no one to sympathize could be found , except for the all too obvious loss of overall humanity that was pictured .probably the most violent sketch , in a film that was a total gross-out ( and i couldn't argue if you chose another scene as more sadistic ) , is the one between two longtime friends sparring at a gym .	1
the film's theme , a recurring one in filmmaker cronenberg's repertoire -- of an unhappy body in a palace revolt -- suggests in no uncertain terms that dreams can kill .instead it relies on the intense performance of oliver reed , as the so-called genius experimenter who lost track of right and wrong , to pull you into the politics of what the film is saying about ethical medicine and the implications it has for the patients and society .while throwing out a lot of nauseating sights and many themes , the film failed to hold together to make this a solid effort , but if viewed for its parts rather than its sum , it had some very strong scenes of relating one's body problems to the constraints of the mind .	1
for those who love the following in their horror tales : schlock , an old-fashioned grand guignol story , and a hammy performance from its star , it should be noted that this film has all that .you the film was atmospheric -- plenty of cobwebs , dark corners , and ghoulish creatures around to add to the eerie tale .this turns out to be a minor film from roger corman's oeuvre , not up to his other more daringly told horror tales .	1
this indie film is set in chicago , comparing the protagonist's working-class background in the produce market with the high culture of the opera world he rejected .not her managers have a divided opinion about giving george a shot at singing something spontaneously in her show , but she sides with giving him a chance , as she aims to make opera more accessible to the public and not to be only for the purists .nevertheless , i loved the atmosphere the film created -- of mixing the stock workingman types with the stock opera types , and with george cutting a nifty path to his destiny between his two chosen fields of endeavor .	1
he has some fun with this theme , taking on the subject matter with mock seriousness , showing a series of attacks caused by marilyn .these scenes are mostly played for shock value , but have a certain sophisticated humor about them and relate a concern about medical procedures , alerting us to the fact that doctors have the power to do just about anything to their patients .one of film's main faults , is that it offered no characters that we could care about , but it instead developed an offbeat story that had some kind of political message hidden in its humor .	1
party ( director/writer : manoel de oliveira ; screenwriter : agustina bessa-luis ; cinematographer : renato berta ; editor : valerie loiseleux ; cast : michel piccoli ( michel ) , irene papas ( irene ) , leonor silveira ( leonor ) , rogerio samora ( rogerio ) ; runtime : 95 ; gemini films / madragoa filmes ; 1996-portugal / france ) the couple are shown to be avid collectors who like to pretend they care about culture but really have these objects only to impress others .it was just too chatty and the characters always seemed to be symbols , too unapproachable to be considered as real people .but i'm a big fan of michel piccoli and irene papas , and i found their performances to be very stimulating--which is reason enough to see this art house film .	1
it's a hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment .s get resolved somehow , and even though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real , the great photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this world .it also looked like it could be a long commercial for beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for club med , or a national geographic tv special , or even one of those action thrillers that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy story .	1
it dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive girls's smiling faces , leaving one with a lingering feeling of helplessness about their situation .adolescence is scrutinized by sofia coppola in a cinematically crafted manner , finely inspired by what we think we remember about that age when looking back at it , with the implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than the other way around .edward lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it , as he seems to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy , which complements a story that can't be completely put together because we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did .	1
wormser ; cinematographer : bert glennon ; editor : thomas reilly ; cast : sterling hayden ( lt .one of the film's pleasures is in the offhand gestures it makes to sim's quirks .it has a fast-pace , a good eye for detail , and some vivid camera shots around los angeles , which made for a tough looking film .	1
a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures .this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well .but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal environment .	1
it's a decidedly corny and manipulative coming-of-age film that never quite grabbed my attention , but it was sure pleasant enough in a surface way , telling an old-fashioned story that carefully skirts any controversy .in a formulaic scene using every ounce of its energy to tear at the viewer's heart , skip wakes up after a life-saving operation , as an immense relief comes over the face of willie .muniz made for an appealing youngster , skip stole every scene he was in , and the understated and elegant performances by both bacon and lane , gave the film some life .	1
it is a darkly violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging , but has its brief moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the union victory meant for the country .but the film could not present a coherent plot , as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its colorful battle scenes .though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way , yet the presentation of the story didn't seem to always jell .	1
david lynch's lost highway , his first feature film after five years , is a surreal thriller with a puzzling plot , that asks a lot from the viewer , as far as accepting this far-fetched tale on face value .but it held my attention throughout and concludes with a roller-coast ride down a dark , desolate highway , with an ending that does little to give meaning to the puzzle .lynch then goes into exploiting his usual themes of violence , gore and dubious sexual situations and we also get to see arquette stroll around in her underwear , when she's not completely nude .	1
it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor .it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy .and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai .	1
there's nothing new presented here : same old answers , same old film , but this one takes itself more serious because of the talented cast and the formulaic way this story was adapted from a simon moore work , which was scripted by stephen gaghan and directed with precision but in an uninspiring way by steven soderbergh .manolo succumbs to being bribed by the drug lords as he is overwhelmed by the money he sees passing hands and does something he would never have done , if not tempted .i don't know what could be said , other than this was a competently made film , the actors were forceful in their roles , with the plucky performance by the conflicted cop benicio del toro outshining the others , and for some comic relief , there was some amusing dialogue between cheadle and guzman .	1
its serial killer scenes are excessive , but they do allow for comedy to soften the blows and , also , since all the victims were not particularly nice people , watching them being mutilated was made more bearable .the last part , when back in the washington , dc area , is a total gross-out , that brings the film down to a mundane campy level , as bad taste takes over , making for a very sloppy and exploitive surprise ending .the nervous , icy but vulnerable persona that moore ably brought to her role , much like foster played it , keyed in on her fight with male authority figures who can't accept her because she's different than they are , more than with her mental chess game with lecter as in the original .	1
a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures .this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well .but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal materialistic environment .	1
this theme has been done better many times before and in a superior way in such films as " shane ( 53 ) " and in clint's own " high plains drifter ( 72 ) . "this film adds little to the genre , except it is a visually stunning film as photographed by bruce surtees and clint's heroics are enjoyable to watch , as he unabashedly brings back many of the western's classic confrontational scenes , such as the showdown on main street and of the helpless man made to dance as the gunslingers fire away at his feet .they are a rough looking bunch of desperadoes , all wearing long dusters , giving the final shootout , a very recognizable western touch .	1
it was crisply directed and well acted , and its quick pace fitted nicely into the stylish way this b & w film was presented .	1
one character says of the farm , it is in such a remote spot , even the coyotes don't come here .deep valley " offers a dramatic look at how love can make one feel alive again .the film comes to a boil with its very moving conclusion , after a very slow start .	1
zhang yang's bittersweet dramatic comedy , " shower , " is meant to be a crowd pleaser .though , i thought , to make his point about the old and new china , he pulled out too many old contrived tricks out of the hat , from the bathhouse being torn down and replaced by a shopping mall , to a retarded brother stealing the film with his comical and good-natured appeal .but what interested me most about shower , is that it gave me a chance to observe everyday life in a country that has been closed to the west , and the film has done it in a most endearing way .	1
and , even though , he is told that the hamam is now out of fashion and the one he has inherited needs lots of repairs , he decides to remain and restore it to its traditional beauty .it was a strange emotional love affair that this film offers its protagonists -- a love affair with a city rather than with another .the film presents a lesson on the old and new cultures of both italy and turkey .	1
under richard fleischer's capable direction , the film does a marvelous job of capturing the realistic flavor of being around rodeo performers .but the love story is rather sappy , and the point about how dangerous the rodeo is , especially for those who get older and can't stop performing , seemed too melodramatic .nevertheless , the film thrived on the very good performances by gig young and the supporting cast , especially by harry morgan .	1
it plays more like a theatrical ghost story or a greek tragedy than a western .it's a film that revels in a dark brooding mystical flavor and of being a revisionist-type of a western rather than one of those traditional oaters .it should satisfy mostly those who are in need to see something different , something that is cultish and attuned to sam shephard's penchant for showing dysfunctional families .	1
this film even gets its title from the part in sullivan's travels when joel mccrea , playing a successful director , wants to stop doing comedy to make instead a serious socially conscious drama called `o brother , where art thou ? 'the film reaches its climactic moment , when they sing in disguise at a political rally and get recognized with a standing ovation by the audience as the soggy bottom boys .i was somewhat disappointed by this big mess of a film ( trying to depict the depression-era in the deep south as in the midst of great social changes due to anything from its music to the tva--with comedy being prescribed as a the cureall for everything ) .	1
it's a colorful adventure story of saloon brawls , romance , and corruption .the stellar cast of stars and noted supporting players keep the action rolling , as everyone seems just right for the parts they are playing .for comic moments , there is the dialogue between marlene and black maid marietta canty , who is yearning for a black dude to appear in the yukon .	1
this b-film also look stilted at times , but was able to go forward with a riveting story and overcome its shortcomings and lackluster special effects ( except for the thrilling walk through the wall ) .it seems that a year's worth of energy takes place in a second and gives scott this superpower .the crudest line of dialogue in this hokum sci-fier , is a question asked by meriwether to lansing : do you want to be remembered as a creator or a killer ?	1
it's a film filled with an assortment of colorful runyonesque characters from the underworld of crime , or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches , or from the outcasts of society .the film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it thinks is crazy into the comic mix , even a shaggy dog story .the rest of this heavily induced homage to musical video films , has a soundtrack that ranges from massive attack to oasis .	1
the filmmaker probably didn't feel confident enough with kensington's testimony in favor of insanity and had winston put on a show for the court to prove he was really nuts .the film for all its soft spots , still had a good but enigmatic performance from mitchum , whose motives for taking on the army bigwigs and putting a dent in his career are never made quite clear .the film was interesting enough in spots to hold my attention , but it defeated its own purpose by making general kempton so politically immoral and wynn so nutty , that the film's liberal message can only be viewed as a muddled one .	1
the problem with this supposedly true story about a genuine russian hero , was that the long middle part was bogged down by an unmoving love triangle and a lot of empty political rhethoric that slowed down the action and took away from the suspense of the two snipers matching wits with each other .the trouble with the film , is that it didn't work well for stretches that were too long , and the only performance i found interesting was ed harris's .if he stops believing in the marxist cause because a girl rejects him as is indicated in the film , then he has to be a more shallow character than the director intended him to be .	1
spanish actor javier bardem portrays arenas ( someone he closely resembles ) with great sexuality , perception and feeling , giving a virtuoso performance .julian schnabel has created an emotionally penetrating look at a man living with his alienation in a marginalized existence and using that bitter experience as a source of energy for his writing .this beautifully photographed film , which looks much like a series of paintings on canvas , might be too bleak for a general audience , but it paints a more realistic political view of castro's cuba than most of the recent films i have seen about this subject , and should be of special interests to those of all persuasions who care about freedom and the arts .	1
but the good news is , that there are laughs to be had , if you are willing to bite into the over-the-top performances , the unseamly sight gags , and absurd plot .heartbreakers " is a forgettable fluff film , that tries unsuccessfully to work its way to romance and also be a caper flick .it works best when showing off the boobs of weaver and hewitt , who are outfitted in dresses sluts would wear to walk the streets , as the film proudly relies on the old adage , that sex sells .	1
anthony mann is a master at directing these cheapie films and making them look stylish .if examined closely , there are many holes in the story , but what works very effectively is how the film shows that middle-class aspirations for the postwar period are tinged with cynicism .it's shown how there's a sense of brutality that fills the everyday american social scene .	1
the mystical theme of evil was never fully developed , but the film was well photographed and acted , and the story was very creepy .there were many odd touches that worked very well , that director freddie francis added to this original screenplay by jonathan rumbold & peter spenceley .there's also a surprise ending that fits in well with the film's theme of man's inhumanity .	1
at the 1998 cannes film festival , this taiwanese-french drama won a fipresci award , given by international critics .what i liked best about it were the half dozen musical numbers sung by grace chang , as the two tenants lip-synch and dance along to the tunes .the film would be interrupted by the fantasy scenes , where the dressed-up protagonists would go into their lively cabaret-like song and dance routine .	1
but it has many plot flaws and suffers from poor pacing and can best be perceived as a precursor to his much improved other 'framed innocent man pic , ' north by northwest .the film can be forgiven for its many patriotic speeches extolling the virtues of america , since there was a war taking place .hitch's first choices of gary cooper and barbara stanwyck would have made the film that much more charismatic , though cummings and lane were not that bad as much as they were colorless .	1
a funny spoof on hollywood , scripted by and starring steve martin . "he has given kit three rules to live by : " there are no aliens , " " there is no giant foot trying to squash me , " and " i feel like i might ignite , but probably i won't . "martin and murphy were never funnier , and the supporting cast adds just the right ingredients to the comedy presentation .	1
a good joel mccrea flick .it is suspenseful , entertaining , fast-paced , and tautly scripted by eric ambler from a novel by geoffrey household .	1
wade didn't see what happened and he doesn't know if he should believe jane , but he doesn't like her solution to the problem and the two of them show that they are cut from a different cloth .the film has the minimal amount of dialogue and holds our attention because the protagonist is a good guy , who ironically can only find freedom when he's in a real prison .the film's main flaw , is that it proves its point by wrapping things up with too nice of a pink bow tied around it .	1
this bizarre supernatural art-horror film is the first feature with all dialogue recorded in esperanto ( an artificial international language created in the 1800s so everyone in the world could speak in the same tongue ) .it's a gorgeously photographed b/w film by cinematographer conrad hall ; a spooky tale about murderous sea creatures .i found this b film engaging in an ingmar bergman way , but without the swedish director's ability to tell a better story .	1
it's a gritty cop movie when the two protagonists are inarticulate and are trying to form a relationship to ease their inner pain .unfortunately , when they do become articulate and mesh together , the film moves into the predictable formulaic mold and ends in a cornball way .but the film can almost be forgiven for its sore points in storytelling , because these two star performers bring something to the screen that is curiously arresting .	1
the film's poetic title can be explained as follows : that the sun always sets instead of rises during the day of an execution .the story was well told , but the acting left a lot to be desired .and all that religious stuff thrown in , about how god listens to you , was strictly cornball .	1
strange bargain ( director : will price ; screenwriters : from a story j .h .a well-conceived mystery b-film , but strictly second feature material .	1
on the island , we see them kiss and are not made aware if anything more intimate took place .this is a suggestive film , touching a tabu subject , but it handles it delicately with an unflinching directness .the current aids epidemic must be faced with humor and real knowledge , or else ignorance about it will cause more damage than good .	1
it is shot in a dull , shadowless manner and the performers seem to be lifeless except for milburn stone , who shines in a rare starring role for him .but it comes too late for anderson , who committed suicide just a little earlier .the plot was too convoluted to give the film credibility .	1
the energy and vitality of these musical scores and a host of bizarrely dressed supporting performers who fill the stage with song and dance , gives this film a comical circus flavoring , which manages to cover-up its clich ?the film has the feel in all its excesses of a ken russell type of musical crossed with any number of hollywood ones , even such an illustrious traditional one as " singing in the rain . "all the main characters played are the usual stock archetypes--nicole kidman was eye catching as the nightclub star and courtesan who is really a sweetie for a whore , but she was too physically big to be handled in a believable way by ewan mcgregor .	1
director claude chabrol has come up with a diverting thriller , that is well-crafted and features a magnificent performance by philippe noiret as christian legagneur .what was missing in this better-than-average thriller , was a sense of passion .everything seemed to be happening in a too matter-of-fact manner .	1
old-fashioned way , the ( director : william beaudine ; screenwriters : from a story by charles bogle [w .it's a different version from the silent screen one that bombed , as here fields is allowed to ad lib and do his thing .fields is in fine comic form here , even doing a ridiculous juggling act with a cigar-box .	1
he replaced the deceased warner oland , and plays chan in a more avuncular style .this film comes at the onset of ww 11 and therefore has a patriotic theme , which is well-crafted into the sabotage story so as not to seem misplaced storytelling . "the best part of this enjoyable whodunit , was that it was hard to guess who ryner was .	1
he was replaced in the film by wheeler oakman , who doesn't have much of a part .the story was a conventional hero against villain one , but the film had a certain splendor about it that elevated its melodramatics .	1
mildred pierce is a noir melodrama that served as a comeback film for waning star joan crawford , who was recently dumped by mgm .the film was nominated for 6 oscars , and joan won the best actress award .but this kid is so rotten and has such a vile mouth , that it's impossible to believe that her mother could still like her so much .	1
a thoughtless formula movie about street racers , that moves so fast from one scene to the next it could be geared for those who suffer from add ( attention defecit disorder ) ; it should give you a few jolts and cinematic thrills , but the price paid is that logic is the first thing thrown out of the car window .the theme of this summertime movie could be that there's little difference in morality between criminals and undercover cops , and that's probably giving the film too much credit for thinking about anything but the box office .the two women had badly underwritten parts , walker was forgettable in his role , and diesel was all high-octane energy , acting either angry or looking tough with his shaved head while constantly flexing his musles .	1
an atmospheric and most entertaining charlie chan episode .it was the longest charlie chan made at 79 minutes and it was the first one not based on an earl derr biggers book .this film was more a case of charlie chan in the english countryside than in london , but why quibble over a title when the story was so entertaining !	1
the film builds to its climax as mina's passion , onced opened up , can't be stopped .perhaps it was because georges was painted as a dull man whose strength was in his hands and in his decency , but who had no interest in fantasy .it seemed to crudely hammer out its point that adultery is a way of escaping a boring marriage , and it seemed more interested in wrapping up the film than in engaging the story with more life .	1
the acting was good , the suspects did a fine job of not letting on who was the guilty one , there was a good comedy routine between the wise guy sheriff and the wise man oriental sleuth , and the story was well-crafted .this was an above-average one in the series .	1
it starts off with some whistling and a monologue by the unseen whistler , just as it was done on radio : " i am the whistler .and i know many things , for i walk by night . "the result is an entertaining b film .	1
that this film is the anti-tourist look at him , one that shows his darker nature and of how jealous and maddening he could be about sex , is a credit to the direction it was aimed at .susan lynch is a bold and daring nora , with a quick uncouth wit and a sometimes long face which changes when she smiles and shows how earthy she can be .the problem with all the stylized intelligence the film brought , which is a fine achievement , is that it always appears strained and never carefree .	1
but he's much smoother than the bimbo girls and shows them his phony id card while smooth talking them .this is strictly an in-your-face film experience , as the director uribe keeps it at a sensual level and never probes for a possibly deeper story .what this does , is make it a film that was diverting because of the nuanced performances by g ?	1
the poverty row studio monogram pictures picked the series up for the remaining episodes and the quality diminished .the film has many plot twists and the usual chan setup for the mystery story to unfold .but the desert atmosphere of the 16th-century castle , the usual comic antics of number two son , and all the suspects moving cautiously around the dark corners of the castle , should please charlie chan fans and give them their usual thrills .	1
an above-average entry into the charlie chan series .this version is a remake of the 1931 fox release " charlie chan carries on , " a film that no longer exists .what made this chan adventure fun was that the many characters in it were easy to know , and it was a difficult case to solve .	1
japanese auteur , beat takeshi kitano ( sonatine/hana-bi ) , one of the more provocative living directors , continues to make unusual films that are difficult to categorize .the film feels very sentimental , but scenes change moods with the drop of hat and it's not that easy to predict what comes next even though it looks in many ways like one of those familiar road pics about a mismatched innocent kid and an adult who's rough on the exterior but really cares inside .the only thing that made sense to me in a positive way , was that they were both outsiders and the filmmaker is saying it will be tough for someone to make it in japanese society unless they are disciplined and pursue from an early age what they want .	1
but if the plot was silly , the fun in this charlie chan story was in watching number one son ( keye luke ) run around like a chicken without a head , seeing charlie overcome being shot in the leg and being kidnapped , and how the film captured the racetrack atmosphere .it makes for a satifactory but not an always well-developed mystery film .	1
this charlie chan episode lacked humor , as there was no number one son present .but despite being a bit dry , it applied the usual formula methods and proved to be entertaining .	1
there was no new ground broken , but it did hit a nerve as to what life in a housing project looks like .the film has a powerful opening , which sets the stage for its tragic tale .the triteness and predictability of the story prevents the film from traveling too far from the reality of the housing projects the filmmaker knows .	1
this is a very pleasant western drama about those who are very good opposing those who are rotten .it makes the most out of its human interest story , as the script by dan ullman slowly builds up to its climactic action scene .joel mccrea gives an outstanding performance as a moral person , who must do what is right even if it means placing himself in danger .	1
an entertaining mystery filmed from the back lot of mgm , though it convincingly looks like foggy london .the only thing that is found inside is a note in red chalk saying : pay or be seen no more !it was strictly lightweight fare , done in a breezy style , but it proved to be an enjoyable b-film .	1
it doesn't make too much political sense and it glorifies the nazi police force of berlin in a revolting manner , but it's a snappy film and quite entertaining .the disclosing of the one masterminding this scheme adds the final surprise to this film that is full of plot twists .	1
it's set on the lower east side of manhattan , with its abandoned buildings and shabby tenements , which gives it the look of a war-torn city .jarmusch is one of america's most talented independent directors , who continues to make original films .this is his humble beginning in films , and the result is a well-crafted technical accomplishment with flashes showing of his great ability to tell a story .	1
edward dmytryk was a victim of the hollywood blacklist , here he returns after a few years in exile to make a stanley kramer produced message drama shot in a realistic style .the film makes good use of the san francisco streets to tell its serial-killer psycho story .the film's message was not that well received , but the suspense of tracking down the nondescript psycho had a good touch to it .	1
sternberg gave this film a blend of realism , german expressionism and hollywood sentimentality .he always wanted to elevate feathers in stature and enjoyed doing it in a crass way , as he gave her jewelry as presents .that he could be generous as well as ruthless and had a laugh that could fill a room with his giant personality , made him a villain who was not one-dimensional .	1
the film ends with a long kiss between the japanese-american detective and the white artist , making a loud statement that it's fine that the heroine prefers someone of a different race .it's a satisfactory fuller work , that is lurid while also reflective of the racial divide in the country .in his gritty way , fuller hammers home the point of the need for racial tolerance and that there's urban alienation out there to deal with .	1
mankiewicz switched greene's anti-american premise around and made it an anti-communism theme , which was to the detriment of the film as it seemed to lose its potent messages .mankiewicz turns it into a feeble murder mystery and an uninvolving romantic love triangle , which is told in flashback .the film was shot in magnificent shades of black and white , and it was filmed on location in vietnam giving it a look of authencity .	1
but this sci-fi spectacle had much in it to be praised for ; it was especially scary , the martian design was sleek and ominous ( there were spider-like characters with cobra-like heads ) , and the recreation of an atomic bomb blast was spectacular .it wisely stuck to the theme of mankind's arrogant belief of his own superiority rather than go the red menace route as most sci-fi films of that day did .they also have anemic blood and because of the darkness of mars , it's 140 million miles away from the sun , they can't handle a strong light .	1
the crime caper was too absurd and trite to carry the film , but the fast-pace and the finale featuring an exciting car chase through the deserted streets of lower manhattan gave the film some oomph .it was a taut suspense film , catching the despair of the protagonist who because of his human failings had a momentary lapse in good judgment and went through a hellish experience to atone for his misdeed .but they just couldn't get any romance going in this film to make the story seem more palpable , as it works mainly for its action sequences .	1
holland's opus ) , directing a screenplay from crazy/beautiful director john stockwell , does rely on wahlberg's sincerity at first -- we easily sympathize with chris' work ethic and passion -- but doesn't allow it to carry the movie later , when the film could really use it .rock star would've been better off as a bigger satire of the time , ripping into the music , the people , and the period , and allowing wahlberg's wide-eyed , once-in-a-lifetime experiences to anchor the movie's emotional honesty and sympathy .aniston could have certainly contributed to that ; i can't imagine too many people staring into those expressive eyes on the big screen and not empathizing with the woman .	1
between the variety shown and the pride taken in skill and passing down of tradition , it's easy to become mesmerized with the culture .at least the emotional expression of the singers provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding about how attached the music is to tradition .gatlif has managed to utilize an old , almost boring , plot structure to respectfully portray a culture much overlooked .	1
an enjoyable monogram made charlie chan mystery , with much trickery disguising who the real culprit is and a very clever premise but one that is not always well executed .there was a flurry of one-liners , confusius-like sayings , and some stereotype racial fright humor by moreland exhibited .it all made for an entertaining but not totally satisfying film .	1
there's supposed to be no one aboard the ship , but all the passengers say they received a call from daniels to come aboard ; though , daniels denies ever making such a call .the boat remains at the dock , as charlie keeps everyone on the ship .this gave the film an eerie feeling and made the fishy story seem less briny .	1
woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy the upholstered apartment furnishings , the lingo of the times , and the clothing worn and hairstyles .the retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed by santo loquasto and shot by zhao fei in mostly plum and gold colors that burnished on the screen .admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the usual woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character , and to make matters worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners with silly double-entendre sexual meanings .	1
richard wallace directs a film noir that is more a character study than it is a puzzler .it was an entertaining b-film that ably caught an honest but desperate man somehow hooking up with a falsehearted woman in a dangerous relationship , as the actors good performances overcame the cheap production values and slight story .	1
a film noir that is more a character study of a small-time jewel thief than one concerned with its pulp story .the artistic shots are like those that orson welles did in " the lady from shanghai . "the film succeeds as a visual feast in noir photography , which includes shadowy framed scenes and close-ups of the characters sweating during the heist .	1
ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the outside influences facing the alienated julia .almost the entire film is a boring rant by julia , where a fine actress like arcelia ramirez just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side .her classical story didn't play like great drama , but felt more like soap opera or a tragic headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing her children for no logical reason .	1
one of those innovative shoestring budget sci-fier films that edgar g .it used the same set designs as ingrid bergman did in the 1948 " joan of arc . "the alien invaders didn't put up much of a fight , but i bet if ulmer had a few more days of shooting time we would have seen a lot more action .	1
considering the budget constraints the film was operating under , this film nevertheless proves to be an entertaining one and features a well-crafted script by jerome bixby ; it is one that is devoid for the most part ( except for the character played by kim spalding ) of stock characterizations .it sets an eerie atmosphere by its shadowy photography and in the claustrophobic setting of the spaceship , and even if the monster in a rubber-suit was not as scary as laughable--that only proves how much fun the film could be .i happened to like it better than i did alien , even though the later is technically far superior .	1
the film was written spontaneously while at the workshop to fit the emotions of the teenage actors recruited .teenager film , is that they are presented as genuine teens even if they are not that appealing and the story might not be compelling to everyone--especially those who watch such loud kids in public places and are turned off by them ( i guess that would include me in that category ) .the film is political in nature and it should be best understood by the teens now living in chile who are familiar with the social climate in their home turf .	1
a gothic mom-in-distress thriller for those who might believe in ghosts or at least are open-minded , or for those who like a scary puzzler story to be grounded in those old-fashioned techniques of getting at the human emotions rather than being a computerized technical special-effects production of the supernatural .the house is not only creepy and filled with ghost sounds , but is enveloped in darkness because all the windows must be covered with thick curtains as the children are mysteriously allergic to the light and if exposed it could be fatal to them .it's a scary movie because it takes on a number of different themes ; such as , madness , ghosts haunting a house , religious dogma , sexual repressions , and hysteria .	1
a chic modern vampire tale that is visually pleasing in its presentation but its scattered storyline seemed anemic , as it wavers between a love and horror story .it also offers a facile philosophy tract on good and evil ( the chinese director studied philosophy in england ) , as the director takes a stab at making this film into a religious fable about finding the truth .it was a strange and stylishly modern vampire tale that is set in london , that tried to be ever so cute and succeeded mostly in being enigmatic and weirdly captivating as both a thriller and a romance story .	1
it's hollywood's version about what psychoanalysis is all about , which is making the analyst a combination of a savior and parental figure who can magically unlock the secrets of the mentally ill by offering them love and concern on a couch .this is the first major film about that subject , and its sincere presentation to show it in its best light is often awkward and seems quite outdated when viewed today .hitchcock throws in a murder mystery that works a little better than all the mumbo jumbo psych 1 lingo the viewer must sit through .	1
it is shot in a semi-documentary style and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film critics have classified it under .the story of duke malloy catches ferguson's interest .to make the film more snappy the producers called in raoul walsh , though not credited , to shoot some scenes over .	1
it has an exciting plot and is properly atmospheric despite its cheap studio sets .the film had the mood of film noir , as milland is the innocent one who has no luck convincing society that he is indeed innocent .it's a scene that perfectly captures the chilling mood this thriller evoked .	1
in this oddity film , wilde is the producer , writer , director , and star .he could have used someone else to give him some help with the plot and he could have worked more with the supporting cast to make their roles more plausible and meaty .the film feels like it's stuck in a strange space-warp , as the all-male treasure hunters are out at sea and are pretty close to going insane .	1
it's also aided by many noirish images and small touches among the supporting characters that give the film a quirky humor , as it scales familiar genre territory from remote gas stations to dead-end dusty roads to hostile redneck bars .there's b-film fun here if you don't mind the many holes in the story and how slight the plot is and how the sadistic trucker can set so many successful traps for them when it doesn't seem possible , and that we are never let in on the secret of how he does it .it's not a terribly interesting film but the director john dahl ( " red rock west " / " the last seduction " ) and his writers clay tarver and j .	1
his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic , straight forward ambitious project of sayles .this is a very strong , independent minded picture , that chooses to tell a very difficult story , one that not many people will take comfort in .but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world .	1
the only fault i found with his direction , is that i thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what hilary and jackie experienced , that is , we didn't have to see it from each one's point of view .this is a film that glows with confidence , sparked by a maturity of material , that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact one's entire life .the film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars , they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and , also , it was deftly handled by the director's ability to keep the movie light , not to make jackie's situation into a downer .	1
and somehow rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise , that is similar in some aspects to the orpheus and eurydice myth , whereas orpheus rescued his love from hades , but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear , he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that eurydice would think that he didn't care for her anymore .it could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters' personality foibles , as they mock or imitate what the real-life troubled modern heterosexuals in nyc are up to , as paul acts out the part at being the tall dark , silent type of macho he-man , who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters : estelle , with her pretentious romantic soul , who is endowed with beautiful breasts ; and her more down to earth sister , who is not the romantic type , but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life , who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence .in any case , this is a very unusual and original work , that is sometimes slow-going , missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good ; but , more often than not , it is right on the mark , using its token males , paul , as an insignificant stud , a servicer of the female race , and jack , as an untrustworthy spouse , perceived as being capable of violent acts , as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man , in a most peculiar way .	1
keitel , if you stretch your gullability a bit , is a great american film director , returning to his native greece after 35- years in the states .this allows for the film to wax poetic , to become a meditation on the landscape , to indulge our sense of the incomprehensible , as we see what the film-maker is seeing ; we all become foreigners in this eeriness , in this lost century , where the truth has been maimed .that is the message delivered , from this politically motivated and visually aesthetic film , full of emotion and bereavement for what could have been , but is now ruined by blind hatred .	1
dark city is a sci - fi/noir thriller , that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity .hurt is the deadpan , hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir film , leading the investigation .but what diminished its positives , was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be , to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying .	1
pi is an earnestly written and directed , low-budget black & white shot sci-fi film that is made for intellectuals , but shows them in a depressing light .it is good to see that a film that is so cerebral and difficult to make can so popularly be received by selected audiences and most critics .aronofsky has his protagonist retreating sophomorically into passivity in lieu of his quest ; this flaw should not be overlooked , it so seriously challenges the film's main character from establishing who he is and from our understanding of what is really being said about intellectuals .	1
religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the film , as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual liberation in a puritan type of setting .the flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused , as too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and comprehend .her sexually explicit scenes with wilkinson added to the religious tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation , but since i did not find their passion convincing , it was difficult for me to believe that their relationship would have taken place .	1
the story is funny , somewhat romantic , though at times resembling more a tv series like columbo than a movie , but in the end turns back to the private eye genre it started out in .i thoroughly enjoyed this uncanny and inventive caper , except for the unconvincing acting between pullman and kim ( she was too lethargic ) -- which made it difficult for me to get involved with their relationship .zero had a light heartedness about it that was endearing and worthy of that mind solving sherlock holmes genre it so alluringly wanted to emulate , but too lacking in overall integrity to achieve more of an original tone to it , than turn out to be a reasonably witty film , achieved under the direction of the young son of the famous film director .	1
emira nusevic plays herself , with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story .what is so forcefully happening in sarajevo , even though it is on the news everyday , has not caught the american people's attention as much as you might think it would .the this film offers an honest portrait of the media in action , as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed .	1
for some reason there is a separate trial for jessie miskelly , the pint sized 17-year-old , who has an iq of 72 , he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner , and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates .jason could hardly say a word , and seems to be mortified , not really aware of what is going on , and appears to have no connection with anything occult , except he likes to hang around with damien and listen to heavy metal music .there is no outcry from the community about injustice , and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate , that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment , which i sincerely doubt , this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed , not only in my questioning of the verdict , but the whole process itself , and wondering if our system is so flawed , that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone , realizing how political all verdicts appear to be .	1
and it works , in an odd sort of way , making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene , even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder .the characters appear in short skits , trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy , spewing out lame jokes and theories , self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies , while many of them are hungering for sex and violence , and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on .it was like a nice cold drink , on a hot summer day , offering me something for my thirst , as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one , after all , the plot of this film is not completely insane .	1
and it works , in an odd sort of way , making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene , even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder .the characters appear in short skits , trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy , spewing out lame jokes and theories , self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies , while many of them are hungering for sex and violence , and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on .it was like a nice cold drink , on a hot summer day , offering me something for my thirst , as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one , after all , the plot of this film is not completely insane .	1
these scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend , as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama , and to a certain extent , a temporary suspension of belief .the young director's previous film , bottle rocket , was also written by him with owen wilson , it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done .there are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order , but after saying that , i must say that this is still a first-rate film , with a lot of bite to it , depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable .	1
there are no heroes here , only lonely people trying to live with their illusions , just like the audience is trying to see them as they were led to believe cowboys should be like .all this might be confusing for those who never dreamed they would see a western with its stars having psychological problems , and worried about earning a living .this is a superior western despite its non-action and debunking of one of cinema's great myths , mainly because of its incisive characterizations of these misfits , and because it was fun watching these big stars work together , especially when realizing that there was a lot of truth in the script that pertained to their real-life situations .	1
what the wachowski brothers are good at is style and visuals , and what we see on screen is ground breaking fun to watch , in the form of exhilarating camera work from the opening sequence onwards , as a mixture of kung-fu and sci-fi schmaltz is used , which is as entertaining as it is ominously intellectually pretentious , as a computer hacker named trinity ( moss ) , she is a take off on mary magdalene , which is why there is no sex between her and neo , just intent eye contact , as she uses her kung-fu and super-natural skills , just like its done in the comics , to escape from a police trap , that comes by way of info an informer gave them .all that talk , all those explanations , every bit of pseodo- philosophical occultism is pulled out of the hat to make the story plausible , except the more rationally it is explained by the group's leader , morpheus , the more holes in his story are opened up , and the judas in his group , who only wants to return to the matrix , in his old job at the factory , is tired of all this hype after nine years of eating the same slop , is played by cypher ( joe ) , now eating a juicy steak with the agents and declaring ignorance is bliss , seems to make as much sense as the mumbo-jumbo morpheus is talking about .he is the modern french philospher , with his theories of time as unreal and his critique of hyperreality and how the truth can't be reached , but violence can , that influenced the wachowski brothers in the making of this film .	1
if we didn't live in a society where so many folks think like him and mistakeningly and arrogantly take the letter of the bible as gospel , then he would be considered a certifiable nut case .what duvall has is zeal , he is a non-stop talker , always railing on about jesus and satan , quoting scriptures , offering up the whole evangelical bag of tricks .that he is annoying , except to those who need to be with someone like him , someone who is demonstrative in his praise of god , someone who can make them feel good about themselves , even if they are a sinner and a lost soul , is another thing .	1
la femme nikita ( director : luc bresson ; cast : anne parillaud , jean-hughes anglade , tcheky karyo , jean reno , jeanne moreau , 1990-fr . )anne , the wife of luc , plays nikita with a flair , exhibiting the tremendous energy and orneriness needed to make the part exceptional .this part of the story lags , as we watch how this violent misfit channels her anti-social aggressiveness into acceptibility for her new role in life , one that society , supposedly , can appreciate .	1
this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story , as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can't become real , without any particular message to deliver , except that these two have their hands full coping with their life , as it seems , it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive .though , what stands out , is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way , that there public appearance might seem calm and collected , but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life .this thought provoking film , touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity , but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness , that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely , as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically , pointing out that maybe , that is all one can hope for , yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up , that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation .	1
this is simply a film that looks at why schools and families , for the most part , impart no concern about " culture " in the children they teach and raise , and why they can't respond with civility and intelligence to those students who need the most help that they can get .he acts more like he was an adult than a teenager , even the rock band he starts , is not a rebellious one , but he does it because it will look good on his resume for college .since the film sinks or swims , depending on how credible heather is in depicting this unhappy youngster with her vulnerabilities , it is safe to say that she fitted the role perfectly .	1
but an unclear story and poor dubbing quality of most of the non-english speaking actors , does not really hamper the absurdity presented on screen , because it is done in such a way , that it defies any critical commentary , having a dark humor about it that is funnier than hell .jean seberg , the much maligned actress , is just terrific in this breezy role , showing a certain amount of vulnerability and courage and sex appeal , and an eye for comic timing , as she takes over for robert when he is killed just before he was going to tell her the info he has about the black boxes , and they were to celebrate the news with champagne and love making .it is a wonderful b movie experience , that rips deliciously into the spy film genre and comes away with a bundle of laughs for all its awkwardness and a ridiculous ending to a story that fails to make much sense .	1
the tremendous effort put into the details and scope of its project , makes it seem stupendous at times , and , even throughout the film , when there are lulls in its story , it still sets a very galactic mood , that is trance-like and illusionary in a positive hypnotic sense , but it does suffer , at times , from being too talky and lacking enough emotions and depth in its story and in its characters , and is scripted with a banal dialogue , plus there is no romance in it , which makes it a film that is more geared to a younger audience , an audience that will be around to follow all the other episodes that will surely come forth .as a positive feature of the film , it is not interested in gratuitous violence , and for that it scores high marks , as there is no blood in it , as all the action scenes involve mostly robotic things being dismantled .some of the more exciting scenes , that weren't crammed too tight with every computerized gizmo lucas could throw at us , so that we were literally choking on too much alien and droid consumption , came from the just gorgeous and eye pleasing set designs on the planets , such as the submerged underwater city on naboo , filled with dangerous sea monsters , and a coliseum-like stadium on tatooine , where the " pod race " transpired , covered by talking head sport's personalities .	1
in it he questions american values , suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice person than to win and stand for nothing but your own self-aggrandizement .it had a great performance by matthew broderick , who was subtle and obvious enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life .yet , the main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the characters involved , there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma that is presented .	1
when this slow-moving film works , and it often does , it is artistically and subtly satisfying to behold , as it spins its simple story in flashback .how this child grew up during that period of transitional southern history , in a climate of racial bigotry and christian hypocrisy , in a family with obvious economic , psychological , and cultural problems , sets the mood for this dramatic story .it offered an interesting observation about the rural south , that is often filmed , but most of the time , it is done with less tact than how it was done here and with less of a real artistic touch .	1
the film throws its bowling ball into the gutter a few times , as it belabors its points about sexual repression and phobias .it is as if , vincent , as the director , is trying to beat us over the head with the point he is making about billy's life being a constant foul-up .this is an uneven but successful film debut for vincent , both as a director and as a star .	1
skarsgard's chilling performance does a pyschological number on his character , and the mysterious and soberly colorful norwegian atmosphere gives this film an appealing flavor , allowing it to appear as if were a noir film .it is worth a look , if for no other reason , than to see how a murder is handled in a beautiful and idyllic country such as norway .but this film has more to offer than that ; it seriously questions police conduct and authority , as it leaves a very damaging message , something that is hard to ignore about authority figures the world-over : questioning if the police are mentally fit for the work they do .	1
and that's the gist of the plot for this sophisticated and superbly acted romance story , that turns the tables on the old notion that the man controls the destiny of the household .because of the expressiveness and raw emotions of the stars , as they go through all kinds of mood swings and power plays until they resolve this very ticklish and perplexing problem they face , we are confronted with a situation whereas pierre has done nothing ghastly to ruin the marriage and the couple still profess a love for each other , yet they are undergoing a separation .a pivotal scene is when the verbal fighting , accusations and hitting take place , that was really unexpected from this urbane couple , except we see it building up and festering inside the stricken pierre .	1
this is werner herzog's first feature and is easily his most conventional story to date ; which , nevertheless , results in a rather interesting drama even if it is a somewhat heavy handed metaphoric one when it relates the mental breakdown of stroszek to the irrationality of war .herzog's characters exhibited many bizarre touches that made them full of life , certainly different from any american film about nazi soldiers .these soldiers seemed like flawed human beings , trapped by the environment they were in and their own idiosyncratic nature , all of which made this ordinary film seem rather special and well-worth taking note of .	1
but what is vividly shown , is how exhilerated he gets from playing the clarinet and how wonderfully morbid he is about everything he does , from eating a vulcanized spanish omelet in spain to getting seasick on a gondola in venice .what might be surprising to a lot of people , is how good the band actually is and how much fun they seem to have playing together .that he receives an engraved plaque for this , encourages woody to joke about how it comes easy for him to be a hero .	1
in his newer film , which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and well-done production than the former , we see these themes come out clearer , brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis , as they each collaborate on the script , as he gets them to improvise in their roles .it is better in the sense , that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the real-life situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing .though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical , a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of , but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts .	1
the movie is a mixture of their music , lifestyles , and an apolitical , quick peek at an impoverished havana .it is done in a wonderfully nostalgic manner , as wenders becomes an admiring fan of theirs , allowing us to see how humble and human these most talented musical souls are .wenders has done a good job highlighting them , though i would have liked to have seen more of their music as performed in carnegie hall , instead of seeing an overabundance of shots showing how well they were received there and how appreciative they were of that rousing welcome .	1
the only part of the film that is in color , is the red letters of the title .agent on vacation , this makes it a federal crime and the f .this film was intelligently presented , the special effects were effective enough , and the cast , especially edmund gwenn , all provided fine performances , all this adding up to a really decent and subtle film .	1
while at the beauty parlor , she is interviewed for the film , filling us in with a more complete look at lenny , as she provided anecdotes , snapshots and home films of him and recalled how he was a quiet child who could have fits of melancholy , but was a happy-go-lucky person most of the time .he also made what he calls a z- film with his wife and friends , a funny low-budget crime film that showed he basically was like the other comics , willing to do anything for a laugh .it became his obsession in life and caused this once slick hipster to sadly be seen losing his cool demeanor .	1
the film was powerful enough in its political jibes to have made the state and the church and the opposition party condemn it .though this is not the director's top-of-the line artistic work , it does fit positively into his opus .it seemed awkward and out of place in this straight forward film , whose darkened cameras captured enough of the sobering mood of poland for the story to be a compelling one , a story about the unfinished business of the struggle for freedom .	1
this comes about after there is an actual lineup in the film , as all the ship's porters are brought in so that dressler could identify the one who threw his luggage in the cab .these two psychopaths are real beauties , and give the film the kind of quirkiness that keeps its brutal scenes counterbalanced with a nice edge of verbal nastiness .this film is not noteworthy for its sadistic story , but what makes it rise above the ordinary b movie , is the strangely provocative dialogue and the utter depravity of all the criminals , who are shown in all their ugliness and unredeeming features .	1
a great labyrinth plot , ala hitchcock , as mamet delves into the greedy corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter competition , and dangles this world in front of us , with all its perks and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate types .this nearly perfectly executed film , never fails to surprise and it accomplishes this by telling an old-fashioned story without one explicit sex scene or one single curse word , earning it a pg rating .steve martin ( that's right , pal ) steals the film with his stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his persona .	1
his performance gives the film a reverberating force , depicting the chaos currently going on in a deteriorating country , and how difficult it would be to reach someone like him , when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by tuning out what he doesn't want to hear .he has infused the film with a raw power , that touches the nerves of the things that westerners understand the least about the russians .it is a film that has its finger on the problems the severe economic decay in russia and the rise of criminals to fill the void of a lost morality , has caused .	1
it also takes a long time to develop as it makes sure that we understand all the people involved and what kind of philosophy about life they have , before we come to the crux of the story .that the amorous professor and the playful and impulsive rosine and the dull leo are shown in equal terms with the industrious magali and the elegant isabelle and the sincere salesman g ?this was rohmer's fourth and final film about the seasonal cycle , and it might be the best one , letting in the most sunlight and being very pleasurable to watch , highlighted by fine acting by all concerned .	1
it symbolically represents the truth that can't be denied , no matter what games the adults ( wife-swapping ) and children ( touching their private parts ) play .ricci's performance is simply breathtaking in its verve , as she appears to be the only one of the teen group who really feels what is going on politically and socially .this film is to be admired for its vividly icy observations of suburban life , letting us clearly see the intensity and restlessness that lies behind the carefully manicured personas of the rich .	1
willie plays the role with rolling eyeballs and other gestures that smack of a stereotyped racism that is upsetting to many of today's african-americans .when willie sees the invisible man , he exclaims , " well , cut off my legs and call me shorty . "this 72 minute film is the kind of old-fashioned comedy that can cheer you up with a few laughs if you are down , or if you are in a silly mood make you feel even sillier .	1
what the film does just right , that caught my interest from a psychological point of view : is penetrate the students' loneliness , the mind-games they play , their ideas about sex and love , their foolish need to lie , and the tribal nature of their relationships .this really fine ensemble cast takes this meandering , real-life type of a story and makes it into an absorbing drama , carefully scrutinizing their intricate and confusing lives .there are a few diverting subplots that are deftly handled by the director , as paul is snubbed by his pretentious ex-friend rabier ( vuillermoz ) , who becomes to his chagrin , head of the epistemology department at the university .	1
it is a politically oppressive climate in the madrid of the 1970s , with the dictator franco in power .there are too many coincidences for me to be wholly convinced that i am not being manipulated into accepting a story with a certain political agenda to it , but there are so many wonderful gripping and beautifully done scenes , that i found i was taken in by the relationships going on and curious about what would happen to these folks , and glad that almodovar ( dark habits , high heels , women on the verge of a nervous breakdown ) has chosen to make a film this time that has a story that makes some sense .almodovar has shot a sophisticated film about characters who really develop character-wise and who are in-tune with the times they live in .	1
and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line .in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything .that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white .	1
in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken .the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets .the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia .	1
when it backtracks and feels that it has to explain itself and sort of apologize for what it has shown , and allows the main character off the racial hook rather abruptly , the story seems to weaken and become somewhat artificial like so many other films of this ilk , afraid to let completely go and allow the chips to fly where they may .what the producers of the film might be afraid of , is that the message about why youngsters become racists was too convincingly done , that their gripes are too reasonable and might leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those who can't face the realities of life in contemporary america .if it didn't back off from its characterization of derek and danny , and if it kept hitting the sore points in society that ordinary people find hard to talk about without getting overwrought or emotionally racial about , we might have had a great film .	1
the coen brothers know how to make a quirky film and they sure know how to write side-splitting dialogue .though sometimes the comic situations and the way all the characters talk funny , seem forced , it still recovers from these lapses and bounces back with more off-the-wall situations once reserved for " keystone cop " comedies , like ferocious dogs chasing the hero , improbable victories for our improbable hero while fighting goliaths , and store clerks who have hidden vengeance inside them .if it is absurd comedy that makes you do cartwheels , something that is unique and dark enough to have some bite in it , then this film is funny enough to overcome some of its failing moments .	1
it's an action flick that questions one's sensibilities and has enough original twists in the story to keep you guessing how many of the cops are corrupt and what method will be used to kill off the yakuza members .there was something very likable about kitano's monster cop that might be hard to rationalize , but it does draw him close to the audience in a surprising way .if you like your violence with a dose of some intelligent dramatics thrown in for good measure , you should find this flawlessly well-paced film satisfying to some degree .	1
what struck me as rather odd for the moment , until i thought further about it , was the film's opening , as the first words spoken are english that come from american bomber pilots flying over okayama , an island village next to the doctor's hometown of hibi , with a pow camp and a factory .what it suffers from is that the combination of comedy and serious drama have too many awkward and slow moments , that show many reactions to what the director visibly feels and makes them look as if they were predictably put into the cluttered story and don't have a breath of their own .a strange farcical comedy results , that is often brilliant and at other times too messy to follow in all the cloudy trails it leads to .	1
the relevance and devastating emotions of the slaves were intelligently presented ; even though , at times , the film was static and seemed to have no legs to get it going in the direction it wanted to be going .it is hard to be critical of the stand for morality and piety the film makes ; but what saved this picture from being the " holier than thou self-righteous bomb " i thought it might have been , were the presence of john quincy adams ( hopkins ) and cinque in the film .that gives the film the force and importance that is needed for it to make its moral point .	1
ripley " offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel , the first being rene clement's " purple noon ( 59 ) , " a more straight- forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldn't do much with .he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person , the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take .ripley's main intent , will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that jude does a good job of conveying , as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side .	1
so you see the direction this film is going , it is cartoonish in characterization , with ridiculous dialogue , plenty of zany characters , and no discernible plot .the john goodman character , of the hot-tempered , ex-soldier , and adage prone advisor to " the dude , " is hysterically funny .it is not as good a film overall as fargo , but it is funny enough to be a minor work in the coen brothers continuing attack on our sitcom culture .	1
but i do find them charming on the screen , as i am able to ignore how inane the dialogue really is and how threadbare the story is , all because there was too much to like about this film to be over critical of it ( i liked tarantino's homage to grier and the '70s , as he plays some delphonics soundtracks and introduces pam's appearance in the film with a '70s soundtrack of bobby womack singing " across 110th street " ) .bridget fonda plays the part of the sex-pot , druggie girlfriend of jackson , who possesses a twisted sense of humor that doesn't sit too well with robert de niro .it is funny even after we see and realize the violence that follows because we don't care what happens to most of the characters in this film , not even to the rather sweet pam , though we are somewhat affected by her desperate situation for a moment or two .	1
it is now considered to be a film classic , outliving the initial rejection of it .i did not feel that there was real passion on screen between the lovers , though i could accept their love intellectually and could understand that their fate was to die next to each other .i thought it had magical qualities and enough of a brooding atmosphere to make up for my inability to be won over by sologne's performance .	1
her sensuality is seen in most of the books she writes , but seems special when she is with jerome , as frontal nudity is there , to be examined from all different angles by a technically efficient camera , that handles these nude scenes as casually as if the actors were fully dressed .the fun in the film is in the silliness of the story's subject matter as juxtaposed against the solemnity of the books being written on skin , with either somber religious chants or the same pop tune being played over and over in the background .the result of this work is a film that is startling to behold , with gorgeous photogenic shots , superimpositions , amazing computer graphics , a splash of intriguing gold and red color patterns , with everything ending up so perverse and lost in an intimacy that seems so melodramatic that even the scenes that do mean something to the characters still seem to be too absurd to really mean much .	1
it is noted for its brooding atmosphere , its classical noir camera work , as the heroine is seen forlornly looking out of windows with bars on them , and the film is particularly noteworthy for the fine performances of its stars , nina foch as julia ross , dame may whitty as mrs .lewis comes up with a few interesting plot twists to make the story even more scary , as the trapped julia fights desperately to save her life , figuring her best chance , is to get word to dennis .the result is a pretty good suspense story and the beginning of lewis's illustrious career in directing a better type of a film .	1
the joke that made me laugh the loudest , was when sean was bawling the girls out whom he pimped for about not bringing back enough money for him that night and they tell him , what do you expect , it's a jewish holiday !the film relies on the quirkiness of penn's performance to tell its lighthearted tale in a mock tone of seriousness , which captures the flavor of that period .her pantomine acting was in the best tradition of silent movies , as through her expressive facial gestures all the emotions she was feeling at the time were clearly seen ; all the long- sufferings that she has gone through .	1
it is not an easy movie to like because the relationship between the two opposites is painstakingly brutal and progresses at a very slow speed , building to both their metamorphoses and an inevitable but not fulfilling conclusion .but there is a power in the raw dramatics unearthed due to the edgy performances , at first told from the woman's point but later shifting to the man's view , that makes this one worth sticking with .there's a lot this movie has to say about meeting the wrong person , and this character-driven work makes the most of it , in this very engrossing , humorous , incisive , but , at times , very upsetting film to watch .	1
the overall effect is that the film seemed different , and therefore one had the odd quality of watching these two eat roast quail in a top-scale restaurant and psychoanalyze each other between munching on their potato soup .wally tells of playing a cat on stage and how some of the other actors who actually liked him , made negative remarks of how he won't be able to perform properly in that costume .the dinner seemed to end on an apology for both to go back to their comfortable lifestyles , momentarily exhilarated by the richness of the meal , the cheer of communicating their thoughts , and by the many provoking subjects broached .	1
the film highlights the interactions of the likable but weakminded lukas and the vibrant emmy ( sophie rois ) to tell its sad tale .ruzowitzky's film throws out many political ideas , gives one a true sense of what collective hatred and what class warfare are like .the film has many different moods to it : ranging from dark comedy to free-spirited romance to bitter violence .	1
but i'll take this polanski version of a horror story over so many others that i have seen recently , there is an elegant craftsmanship and an ability shown by him , to keep one in suspense for most of the film without resorting to hollywood's special effect grab bag of tricks typically used for this genre .i was also impressed by the way darius khondji's cinematography took me around europe , into castles , private library collections , voyeuristically looking into dark corners , and into a devil worship ceremony .but , that aside , i still maintain that this picaresque film adapted from arturo perez-reverte's popular spanish novel el club dumas is better than most satanic thrillers , especially those recent ones relying on blood and gore to shock the viewer .	1
a more-than-acceptable variation of jacques tourneur's cat people ( 42 ) , that is excellent in spots , but lags in its overall pacing .the scene is marvelously done , as it cuts away from the leopard's attack to picture leonora enjoying this revenge .though very imitative of the tourneur film and not quite as masterfully done , this rarely shown horror film is worth catching for its dark intensity and the eerie mood it sets .	1
refn moves the pusher along with an inward existential beat to it and outwardly we hear the loud pulsating electric music of heavy-metal .there are some chilling scenes thrown in , that are not shocking , but represent the matter-of-fact violence that is taking place .whether frank lives or not , becomes less important than in seeing what a hell he has made for himself , desperately trying anything he can , to outhustle his way out of this mess he is in .	1
the wilderness and the snowbound land are visually appealing , while the eskimos come across as a friendly people , easily given to smiling , even if some are suspicious of the white men , thinking of them to be useless as hunters .the filmmaker massot shows the filmmaker flaherty staging shots of eskimos building igloos , sleeping together , and lots of faked shots of eskimos doing things solely for the camera .but somehow the film works in a very human way and the thrill of seeing the eskimos live in such harsh conditions is something few westerners can readily comprehend or for that matter , have ever seen before .	1
this is a particularly violent and crude noir work , whose subject matter offers a penetrating look at the american occupation of japan , basically saying that what the u .their love story left an empty feeling in the pit of my stomach , as there seemed to be a psychological separation between the two that couldn't be reconciled .even though the story had a lot of loose ends to it and didn't make sense most of the time , the strangeness of the characters and the oddness of the location made for a telling tale , a sure-fire iconoclastic fuller experience , for a director who just goes into a film and grabs what he wants out of it , not caring a darn about how silly it all looks .	1
how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue .at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony .puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking .	1
the other problem , with this otherwise splendid history lesson and tragic love story , is that all the movie's metaphors are used as if they were merely to amplify the historical tale .it is noteworthy for exploring in detail the destruction of innocence and the arbitrary splitting up of the earth , and how everyone gets caught up in the emotional frenzy of hatred and how difficult it is to just do what is right .his masterful performance , changing from an endearing and helpful figure , to one who embraces violence , was what put a human face of evil on this melodrama and saved the film from being thought of as mostly a metaphorical historical exercise .	1
a powerfully haunting film , that should leave one with some deep emotional pains over its human drama or turn one completely off by its obvious political intentions .the film shows by comparing her mood swings to the natural surroundings , the vast and changing sky , how small she feels , how it has sunk into her how far apart she is from the things she loves to do and how much she misses her warm family .the beautiful camera shots of the landscape and the poetry of the girl's loss of innocence , were undermined to a certain degree by how this allegory unfolded .	1
the heroine in this wacky autobiography learns the hard way that it pays to be unique , even if that might require an acceptance of her being unhappy , if the alternative is , that happiness means that you have to be like everyone else . "tomei gives a wonderfully over-the-top performance as a lost soul , who brings her quirky antics into a household that is trying to act like " people " but can't seem to make it .it touched on all the nerves that made this into an intense dramatic scene , that worked so well because the script was tight and the actors were well-cast , with especially natasha lyonne , as the girl who was always being surprised as she tries to find out who she is .	1
this film was adapted from a lucille fletcher 22-minute radio drama , where agnes moorehead played the invalid heiress leona stevenson .the film plays on one's fears of being alone and of being physically handicapped .even as an intolerable woman , casting herself in self-imprisonment , she engineers our sympathy for her current plight , as we see that she desperately needs psychological treatment more than anything else .	1
the film has caught the gypsy mood and their persona : the gypsies here have gold teeth , the women bathe together in the nude and talk about the men in a frank sexual manner , the men drink a lot , play music with deep feelings , curse on a regular basis , and are quick to smile and see the humor in almost everything they do ." gadjo dilo , " in the gypsies' romany language , means " crazy stranger , " which becomes a reference to the french youth and the film's title .gatlif succeeded in setting an evocative gypsy mood , touching on their charms , highlighting their moving music , demonstrating the sheer joy in their wedding ceremonies , and leaving a good taste in one's mouth about the gypsy spirit to survive .	1
this creepy serial killer tale had all the more fright in it than the more highly touted " felicia's journey , " and was a superior telling of a homicidal maniac on the prowl story than the more flamboyant venture " american psycho " was .hampton fancher , the blade runner screenwriter and the first-time director of " the minus man , " creates a film that sets a dark mood of everyday normal life contrasted by the cheery personality of vann , who looks like the average " joe , " easily fitting into his surroundings .the emptiness of his action , and the film's emphasis on his charms , while keeping his past mysterious , adds chills to his moody persona .	1
sacha vierny , as cinematographer , supplies the film with striking visuals , every scene is beautiful to behold .the film might not add up to much in weight , but the sum of its parts were like an apple hitting newton on his noggin .it had one mesmorizing visual scene after another , and gave one enough fodder to think about all the spiritual and corporeal themes it just spread before your eyes without going further into them .	1
the film makes it a point to show that the fictional region has its quota of local eccentrics , many of whom are related to one another .for the most part , the film is done in a campy way , balanced by veteran character actor ernie hudson playing his role seriously , taking offense at the racial slurs and showing that he's a powerful man , willing to take a strong stand for what he believes in .the film is most similar in racial tone to " to kill a mockingbird , " but is played more humorously and with less drive for its interracial sexual motives being the source for the crime .	1
their conversations and snide remarks while carrying on the investigation brings on an element of comedy , which seems absurd in the face of how horrid the murder is , but it is diverting .this explanation of what she did , seems far-fetched and takes away a lot of credibility from the story , which had been thus far , a very ably put together murder mystery .it works as an entertaining and well-acted thriller that could have used more imagination and less gruesome sexual details in telling its story , as the military cover-up might have been a more interesting direction to go than in dwelling on the sordid crime .	1
what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product .he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out .but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .	1
he effortlessly transfers locations from denmark to the new york city of 2000 , which shows how malleable hamlet is and how right it seems to take it away from its staginess and sole reliance on dialogue instead of making it a more cinematic experience .but what almereyda fails to do in this slenderized ( no gravediggers here ) version of hamlet , is make his modern visuals jive with the staginess of the bard's words , therefore the film always felt jarring .by not changing the tone of the shakespearian dialogue to the neurotically nasal everyday speech of the modern new yorker , while radically altering the visual effects to fit in with the current times , the film developed a split-personality , which it was never able to recover from .	1
''its their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical , following in the long tradition of salesmen films from -- death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross .he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burnt-out .but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .	1
the epsteins are wonderful musicians and storytellers , openly explaining their music and talking about themselves with no pretensions or false modesty .it also goes on a dull side trip to pinsk , a place that borders russia-poland , where their parents are from , but someplace they are unfamiliar with and because of that there was nothing worthwhile to see there .but , in all fairness to the director , aside from a few lapses in the film , he did capture the essence of the kletzmer music and what makes the epsteins so special .	1
written and directed with style by richard shepard ( the linguini incident ) , " oxygen " is a compelling psychodrama , whose story is sickening but is superbly played by an excellent cast .it was clearer to find out what was troubling harry than it was to get to the bottom of her problem , but her characterization of a pained woman was almost as interesting as his .but for sheer excitement , the fast-paced film moves rapidly along to see if the police can get to the buried frances in time , and in the meantime , brody gives the performance of his career so far . "	1
in the child's head , she is dressed as a princess in a white feathered gown , standing on glistening island sand with a crystal clear sky invading the senses with an array of brightness , that could be as inviting as a tourist commercial for travellers , except there is a bizarre quality about these images that is more than an eyeful for an ad .jennifer lopez is surprisingly credible as a therapist and the one the film hinges on to take us on this mind trip , vince vaughn plays his low-key role in an expressively adequate manner , and vincent d'onofrio elicits some sympathy for being a victim of child abuse while also seen as an over-the-top psycho , someone who is capable of torturing women for no logical reasons .the film had enough visual material to keep you looking at it and wondering what does it all mean since it wasn't a very frightening serial killer picture , and its mind explorations did not take us down some unmarked jungian trail .	1
this film had a very skillful way of telling its story about a bygone era , doing it in an effortlessly grand style , with a tongue-in-cheek humor .besides , any film that has a clip of the marx brothers breaking up a symphony orchestra to make it seem like a baseball game , has a good idea of when to be humorous and when to point out the seriousness of the slurs hank had to go through .the only fault of the film , was that the director became too close to his subject , and perhaps , overdramatized the effects of greenberg .	1
the film has an immediacy about it , but it also seemed overly melodramatic at times , relying so much on the premise , that by being as good as the germans , the italians , the slave-race , can prove that there was no need for the war since there is no such thing as a master race .the other professional actor among all the nonprofessionals to standout , was the priest role as warmly played by aldo fabrizi , who elicited a call for sensibility and caring for people .though , the film does not seem as relevant as it was when first released and acclaimed as a masterpiece , having lost some of its purity , nevertheless , it still retains its moral high ground and its ability to show the collective will of the people , who resisted being oppressed .	1
the performers were outstanding , as i was especially pleased with marcia rodd's captivating portrayal of someone with spunk .the film was torridly on target and eerily funny , but only to a point , as it seemed to create such a far-out situation , that it was difficult to keep laughing when there was so much cynicism and so much that went beyond the pale of farce and became too arcane to decifer where it was leading to .when elizabeth wilson has the film's last word and says , " you don't know how good it is to hear my family laughing again , " this coming after they acted as snipers , which leaves the black humor with a very tainted message that bears watching .	1
the caper is also more fun to watch , has much more splash to its story line , and is better looking than the original .the film looked so glossy and flew by at such an easygoing pace , that it was an enjoyable guilty pleasure , a delicious hollywood film for those looking for escapism and a romance that portends to be steamy and intimate , but is really glib and only superficially satisfying .it was an ingenious scene , where many impersonators of a magritte painting , who are dressed in imitation of the picture , as inconspicuous businessmen in dark suits and bowler hats , carrying briefcases , make it difficult for the police to keep tabs on them all .	1

it is done in a delicately stylized form , filmed mostly in dark , somber shades , as the story revolves around the characters in an office/residential building in toronto .the film moves along at a brisk pace , which kept me interested in their lives , but what the story failed to do was tell me all it can about the characters .jeremy podeswa ( eclipse ) , the writer-director , has come up with a captivating film despite the shallowness of the characters and the story being a landmine full of clich ?	1
this is a brilliantly acted picture , especially the performances of both sean connery as the veteran policeman but the now emotionally tortured inquisitor , sgt .it framed its shots in an exaggerated arty manner , which took away from the subtlety of the unfolding story .the film remains fascinating , aided by impeccable performances and a dialogue that has some bite in it .	1
it is another heartless stab by the director aimed at the heart of mankind , showing them at their stupidest and cruelest moments , one that tweaks the sensibilities about american pop culture and its whimsical effect on the population .this modern adult fairy tale , told in the style of the " wizard of oz , " is also set in kansas and has the heroine , ala dorothy , leaving that rational state for one of fantasy .this tale was spiced with too much human depravity and insanity , making betty to be anything but another dorothy gale , but more like a crazy person or an idiot .	1
movie about the mentally ill and how they manage , as the acting remains controlled and is too earthy for the story to become compromised by a sugary resolution .its beauty lies in how honestly the story is told and in showing how difficult it is to find love and then lose it through something you have no control over .it lacked real affection for the couple , as they seemed forced down our throats instead of being allowed to grow gradually on us .	1
shot almost entirely on digital video with a hand-held camera , miguel arteta's ( star maps ) chuck and buck is an arresting homo-erotic tale about the pangs of growing up while still stuck emotionally at an adolescent stage .these scenes are the heart of the film , as they bring out whatever brilliance there is to be found in the characterizerations , depicting in an honest way how those who are not destined to live a conventional life behave with each other in a natural setting .the film seemed to run out of steam at that point , having exhausted itself of its underlying probe into the tormented soul of buck , who is seen more as a pathetic figure who is desperately in need of being touched , someone who does not possess the social skills to relate with others .	1
this is rohmer before he mastered his craft , but there are signs here of the greatness that was to come in his later films , as its rawness makes up for its lack of sophisticated form and nonstop chatter .the film is loaded with an erotic tension , as rohmer's camera remains fixed on her perfect body , her pagan-like bronzed figure and her attractive short-cropped haircut .this is a very wry film not suited for all tastes , but it is a good introduction to the early rohmer , that has a lot to say about human nature and says it in a very french way .	1
the film is slightly offbeat , feeling very natural and human , and offering a chance for the characters to be somewhat fleshed out as they intermingle and search for relationships .yet i enjoyed the film and its loopy moments and thought it did a good job of catching the banter that goes on between the twenty-somethings , struggling to make relationships and fight their fear of loneliness .but he has met his match with syd , as the two discuss kierkegaard's dark secret nature and compare it with the opera don giovanni , which takes on the film's theme and makes way for relating that to the eventual transcendence of dex .	1
there are also some interesting casting choices he makes such as , a cameo for angie dickinson as gwyneth's grandmother and the noted singer huey newton in a starring role , whose expressions and looks reminded me of sydney pollack .this story is the most bizarre and implausible , but it has the strength of bringing out a number of small truths that add up , allowing the film to maintain a quirky sense of justification for its messiness .these stories don't exactly connect for these disenfranchised folks , but it shows what happens to them psychologically when they come to a crossroads in omaha , making it appear to be the super bowl for dreamers in the world of karaoke -- their chance to heal their wounded egos as they steal someone else's talent for a few moments and call it theirs .	1
but the narrator poses the question , is it a dream of madness on a dark night -- or was it real ?this is a bizarre film , a precursor to welles' " touch of evil " and polansky's " repulsion . "if not made to be understandable , it is at least a very demanding depiction of someone demonically possessed by guilt .	1
it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel .there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to .it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel .	1
setting the dark and torturous mood with her soundtrack is alberta hunter's most appealing blues score , which she also performs .the irony in it , is all the main characters watch the news report , but it is too impersonal for them to even react to it , they are too overwhelmed with the problems in their personal life to care about anyone else .i remembered emily's name by the time the film ended , and felt moved by her strained performance and all the emotions , pathos , and humor that was in it .	1
the cast is so good that it overcomes the shrill oratory , the manipulative , obvious and unbelievable political situations , and an ending that tries to play it so safe , that it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in the first place .the story in itself is more soap opera than drama , but what gives it verve is the super performances from the three stars , jeff bridges , gary oldman , and joan allen .the film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to deliver with some bogus pat speech and , instead , set up a logical argument showing that senator hanson should be confirmed for office despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal .	1
the scenes are colorfully shot on a studio location , while it also shows him writing and directing the actors , as they go from song and dance numbers into serious acting sketches .the creative , political and personal struggles of the filmmaker were well-presented and superbly acted , in this imaginative and enchanting production .it is a zesty film , adopting many different themes and styles , from gene kelly dance numbers to fellini fantasy scenes .	1
nora ephron directs this farce with the aim to mine all the laughs taken from the foibles of the slow-witted characters and pull all the nuggets out of their characterizations that adam resnick scripted , as the film holds up rather well until the clumsily navigated tidied up ending , which made no ethical sense .the key ingredient to this comedy , is john travolta , who was never better in a comic role , and the good chemistry between him and lisa kudrow , who as a sexpot with a heart of steel , is just fabulous in making her character both despicable and amusingly likable .lucky numbers " didn't hit the jackpot , as the story was too shallow to allow for that , but i got some good comedy action for the price of the movie ticket .	1
kluger is perceived as being tougher and smarter than the d .the final shoot-out is well executed and though the story is as plain as vanilla , it still had plenty of tough action .feist directed this tough b&w noir film in a gritty and pleasing style .	1

a solid noir melodrama from vincent sherman , who takes a standard story and dresses it up with moving characterizations and beautifully expressionistic b&w photography from cinematographer james wong howe .the film proved to be popular with the public , especially with the women in the audience , and it turned out to be a big hit for ann sheridan .the glossy story might not be much on paper , but the telling of it was superb , showing how trapped the main characters became because of their lie .	1
it is a deliberate film , doing a grand job of setting up the characters and the tough situation they are in , with the visuals telling the story as powerfully as it can .the brick fights between the rival gangs and the angst of the mother , not understanding what to do , seemed genuine , in this semi-autobiographical work by the mackinnon brothers , gillies and billy .it caught something real about growing up in such a rough environment , but the acting was not that great by the kids and when all is said and done , the brothers were made into stock characters .	1
there are all his stock characters present , the rousing song to stir one's heart is there as the cavalry troops ride by with stan jones singing 'i left my love , ' there is the formula story of the men in order to be respected proving themselves in combat , and finally the film has ford's ongoing patriotic message that this country is for everyone who has the guts to fight for it .there is no plan made for how they are to return to friendly territory , except they should incur as few casualties as possible .the film has a lot of gory scenes of surgery , which included showing the amputation of a leg .	1
it felt at times like i was watching paint dry on the wall , but the reward for sitting through those excruciatingly redundant scenes , was in seeing something different , something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident , as i believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice in commenting on the violence in american society , especially against women .the film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to little snippets of , hearing mostly their curse words .its filming of the arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary about the crime scene , is the understated reason for the origin of the violence , contrary to the way hollywood films portray violence .	1
don roos ( " the opposite of sex " ) , the director-screenwriter , has come up with a smart script and lets his adult stars act like real adults do and is not ashamed of the glossy film becoming a tearjerker , and when the romance story tugs shamelessly at my heart it feels good because there is a heartfelt rhythm in this film that allowed me to clearly see what the troubled couple is feeling without it seeming to be contrived , even though it is contrived .affleck is good as an actor conveying someone who is arrogant and shallow and full of false bravado , but is not convincing as someone who has been down for the count and is bouncing back as a changed man .it left me wondering , how sensitive of a person could he really have become , if he could only help her materially and not understand that his drinking masked deeper problems he had in his character , such as lying !	1
without any proof , ellen fails to believe him .the story had a lot of holes in it , including an inadequate explanation for budd's motivation for wanting dorothy dead in the first place , but it still played as a good nightmarish mystery yarn , with an icy robert wagner tremendous in a villain role for a change of pace from his usual good guy roles .	1
this is a creaky horror film , with plenty of fun moments in its wobbly story .it is played mostly as a spoof on vampires , but has a nifty murder mystery going for it , plus some gimmicky camera work featuring an apparition and the scary dark castle filled with strange sounds , cobwebs , spiders , bats , and rodents .it's a classic horror spoof , well worth seeing for either nostalgia purposes or lighthearted fun .	1
bruce robinson , the creative director and writer of " withnail and i , " has come up once again with an original film , which again stars richard e .ad men could very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet earth , is a point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before i get it .the cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility required , with richard grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous ability to verbalize .	1
a snappy b-film thriller , excellently paced for broad sweeps of comedy and fright .lew ayres stars in a film he says in a magazine interview , " is the kind of picture actors do when they need work . "basil rathbone , who was a big star at the time of this film , had a small part as the villain .	1
somehow this quirky , egocentric , fantasy black-and-white film about a british filmmaker learning to dance the tango from a master , works in an obscure way by getting us hooked on what's going on .the 48-year-old sally potter ( she plays herself ) , while filming in paris a technicolor thriller ( it seemed like dreck and is probably some kind of personal statement potter is making about hollywood films ) about a legless fashion designer in a wheelchair murdering models dressed in brightly colored costumes . "the film managed to look good and even though pablo and sally are no great shakes as actors , and their stiff romance was more pitiful than meaningful , the film had a bizarre strain to it , of this very uptight sally learning how to loosen up and the sly pablo jumping around like a fox at a hunt .	1
this theme takes hold of this dark film and overshadows the milder intrigue about macready , himself a nazi collaborator , fronting for a nazi-controlled tungsten cartel .the clearest summation of the story comes in the film's most sensational and memorable scene , as gilda is dressed in a tight-fitting black satin evening gown and sings 'put the blame on mame , ' intoning in an erotic manner what is eating away at johnny while suggesting a full striptease by removing a glove .it's a studio film , with even its revealing carnival scene , an unloading of sexual repression and delve into the unconscious , done indoors on the cheesy hollywood set .	1
even though night has matured as a director , this surprise ending is not as engaging as the one he came up with in the blockbuster the sixth sense , which caught audiences completely off-guard .the action in it seemed obligatory and not really germane to the story , as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced to prove that david has the super-powers of the comic book hero .this encounter , of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked right , as it seemed flat and arbitrary , spoiling but not ruining the overall achievement of the film .	1
it is artfully directed by leconte , with his choppy camera work matching the mediterranean's bubbly sea movements and the trembling nature of the feature players , plus his smoothly dark photography makes it seem as if he's filming a 1940s noir work , and his eclectic musical background soundtracks ( ranging from benny goodman to marianne faithfull and from italian to turkish music ) adds an excitement to a story that changes moods from comical to tragical at the drop of a knife .the power in the film's punch comes mostly from the imaginative performances of international pop star vanessa paradis , the girlfriend of johnny depp , and from one of france's most popular and best actors , daniel auteuil .these two have an electricity together that is , indeed , magical , with both featuring very expressive facial gestures and large eyes that open wider when welcoming the viewer into their story in a most hospitable way .	1
as a result , when the film's last act rolls around , what happens all feels contrived and overacted , and i felt manipulated , especially when i saw that the sweet little girl is even willing to die for her grandpa .though the viewer is being shamelessly manipulated , the story feels so strong and right , that it seems easy to get caught up in the emotions of the moment and the beautifully arranged images that lit the screen up with magical faces and gorgeous sets and costumes .the film got ever so mushy , but it was so cleverly executed and i was gladly taken in by zhou ren-ying and zhu xu pulling on my heart strings .	1
the story is aimed at striking your funny bone and getting you dizzy in following all the plot twists .red rock west " is a playful and off-beat thriller , whose only sense it makes is nonsense , but one that is highly entertaining , while the film itself is well executed and the acting is dead-pan funny .it has received cult status because of its many plot twists and zany characters , which means it will pop up on late night cable at any time in the future and that should be for years to come .	1
honestly .spoiler in the next paragraph .their superb characterizations about the cowboy's hard life and romantic visions , living as loners , often traveling on dusty roads into one-horse towns while hanging out in tawdry bars , gives this film a special force , filled with a moody noirish atmosphere .	1
it's a story that crosses religion and spiritualism with worldly cynicism and murder .while under the capable direction of mike hodges ( get carter ) , the film is superbly paced and plays up the ambiguity of the story in a satisfactory manner .the result is a stimulating film for the intellect and a challenge for establishing what one's reality is .	1
the dark rainy streets of belfast and the brooding mood of mason , made this film look much like a noir feature .it is preachy in spots , trying to show many different sides to the struggle , where characters along the way seem more like symbols than real flesh-and-blood .but there is a lot going on that the film left uncovered from the point of view of what the revolutionaries are protesting .	1
a very good sequel to " the invisible man ( 33 ) , " though not as imaginative as the original .the search for the killer was too obvious to be interesting , but the fun to be had was when the side effects to the serum kicked in and geoffrey became egomaniacal .the film received a nomination for a special effects oscar in 1941 .	1
a risky commercial venture that sometimes works in a serious way but is somewhat beaten down by the lack of vision it exhibits while in its romantic mode , as opposed to how alluring it was as a moralistic survival film .the film is carried solely by tom hanks' splendid performance , with him reflecting without the need of dramatics or dialogue the changes he is going through , as he acts through use of facial expressions and body language .the major fault of the film lies in the capricious ending , where it ran out of story and didn't know how to make hanks' return to memphis and civilization shed some light on what he's been through without trivializing that experience .	1
the magic in the film did not come from the light comedy and the overworked romantic situation , which was mindful of a french farce , but from the sexy chemistry caught on the screen between the two and the way they looked natural dancing together .the film's showdown takes place in venice , which is an artificially staged version of that great city , where madge is staying in this opulent but gaudy art deco hotel , waiting to play matchmaker and introduce jerry to dale .this catchy romantic farce should hit the mood of those in need of lighthearted escapism to cheer them up ; and with its show stopping musical routines , it has reached the status of being a film classic .	1
there's a surprise that is revealed during the end credits : this fascinating documentary turns out to be a mock-documentary , after it hits you over the head with the problems facing many american workers during the changing times of the 1990s and spends the entire film looking like a real documentary .that it was not for real , does take away a lot of the film's impact and poignancy , but still it leaves the viewer with a sense that it cut through something perplexing that is currently happening , that is part of the human drama that causes some strange behavior to emerge .hexter has thrown open a look at all the social , political , and economic factors involved in the evolution of a small town , and he has done a nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most important thing to consider , even though in the bigger picture things might look like they are working out , there's still a face you have to put on someone who loses his job .	1
the film still seemed to be too dry to care about an unfamiliar muslim language and an intellectual culture no longer in vogue , dying a slow death .as worthwhile a project as it is , as adapted from anita desai's 1987 novel , in which she also does the screenplay , it still is hard to bring an intact literary work and make it viable as a cinematic experience without changing it .the film's main failure is that it never comes to life as a moving poetical work but always seems like an academic exercise , through no fault of the director .	1
le petit soldat suffers from flaws due to its poorly crafted plot and in the director's inability to tell a story that brings out all the dramatic tension .this film , thankfully , didn't have all the polemical fire in it that godard's later works had , instead there's much to find here that is enjoyable and i dare say perceptive , especially if you can overlook the director's pedantic ways .le petit soldat suffers from flaws due to its poorly crafted plot and in the director's inability to tell a story that brings out all the dramatic tension .	1
a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo .the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ?it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .	1
the film was well-crafted , perfectly photographed in b&w , as it maintained a breezy pace and threw into the story some comedy and romance .they are not told how they will die until they hear a loud ticking sound .aside from its serious political message , this was a slapstick comedy , and a mystery story much influenced by those american serials , which were very popular at the time .	1
at last , after many recent bombs , gere has found a film that goes hand in hand with his laconic style and intelligent grace , as he plays a sympathetic character , someone who seems very comfortable with this dazzling role around so many women and comes across as a good doctor and a generous person who is trying his best to be the man around a sea of women .there doesn't seem to be much tragedy here , it seems that script writer anne rapp and the 75-year-old altman are only gently chiding the doctor for thinking he can ever understand women , and the film plays more like a big joke on him than anything else .what unravels for him , are all things he can easily rebound from , as the film ends with the song " ain't it something the way things go " being played as the credits roll by , after an unpredictable ending to a sweetly bizarre film .	1
director gore verbinski ( mouse hunt ) does a nice job tightening up this rambling story when it needed it and keeping the action flowing , though a few of the comedy scenes , such as the one that opens the film , seemed contrived .julia roberts plays a familiar part to her by now , of someone who doesn't have all her smarts , who is very likable when sticking to her work-type characterization of someone trying to get in touch with her feelings through reading self-help books and having conversations about sensitive topics .while cinematographer dariusz wolski's location shots of the beautiful mountain town of real de catorce were spectacular and made this a very pleasing mainstream film to view .	1
it held my interest as i observed the classroom dynamics taking place in a broken down one-room schoolhouse and in the contrasting lifestyle shown in the modern chinese city .the cast of mostly nonprofessional actors , playing themselves , acquitted their task with a spirited performance , giving power to the story about the problems with rural education for the poor people of that region .this fictional story was better than the message delivered , and the film is much better than it sounds , given the aforementioned flaws it has , it still shows the power of human love over all the coldness in the world .	1
his most memorable role was in the lodger as jack the ripper , a film that was similar to this one , only presented in a more subtle psychological framework and became recognized as one of the more interesting serial killer films made .cregar gave a nightmarish performance that was staggering and memorable , while linda darnell was alluring as the scheming chanteuse .it is also noted for its exciting bernard herrmann score whenever the action picks up .	1
it's a routine revenge western but , nevertheless , has elements of the quirkiness peckinpah's films will later on become reknown for .this film is visually powerful in spots , as it overcomes its routine theme with burning images of lust , greed , and hatred .maureen sings the film's theme song during the opening and closing credits .	1
a good story is infused with too much symbolic pretentiousness , yet the overall effect is absorbing .the film won an academy award for best screenplay and director for john huston , while his father walter huston won for best supporting actor .this black and white film is very well acted , especially by bogie and walter huston , but is not as gripping and intriguing as john huston's masterpiece -- " the maltese falcon . "	1
the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts .what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring .also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors .	1
there are 5 short vignettes where the characters seamlessly intermesh .the film won a prize at cannes last year , but still is not released to theaters in this country .this is a smart film that gets amazing characterizations from all the actresses , each giving a wonderfully nuanced performance exhibiting inexplicable and heartfelt emotions .	1
robert lord won an oscar for best original screenplay .the director , tay garnett , allowed for satire to carry the comedic load and his instincts were correct , as the film worked , easily overcoming the story's melodramatics .it is interesting to note that kay had a speech impediment , not being able to pronounce r's , therefore the script tried to give her as few of those sounds in her dialogue as possible .	1
this human interest drama is one big metaphor about a strained father and daughter relationship .it's a film that avoids cliches for its answers , has plenty of energy , and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by both lena headey and stellan skarsgard ." aberdeen " is thematically similar to mike figgis's " leaving las vegas , " except there the end of the journey was most important , here it is the journey itself that counts the most .	1
the 36-year-old filmmaker studied at ucla and was the cameraman for quentin tarantino's pulp fiction and reservoir dogs .the film is not plot oriented , it relies on a bunch of episodic incidents to take place before tarek gets it through his clownish skull and smirking face that this city has changed and won't be the same again .the director also presents us with a flavor of the slang language used by the locals , with expressions such as : " you're shish-kabobing me on a small flame ; " or " you drive like steve mcqueen ; " and , about a buxom woman omar says , " what a piece of lamb ! "	1
they realize they are the victims in this marriage but can't act out their repressed feelings , they are too worried about what others might say and do not want to be thought of like their spouses .nat " king " cole sings a host of soft ballads that reflect the film's steamy mood , while the couple often get caught walking in a rainstorm , or riding in a cab together , or nearly touching hands , or brushing past each other on the stairs , or expressing through their facial gestures their feelings of love . "it is a film that is hard to put out of your mind ; and , a lot of the credit for that should go to the two big stars of hong kong cinema , leung and cheung , who are simply mesmerizing .	1
mamet's second effort as a director , after his diabolically successful house of games , is a totally different styled film .the director's witty dialogue and penchant for interesting plot lines are there , but this film is not as sharp-edged as his other work .this scene is brilliantly done , a true pleasure to watch as the men through long drawn-out silences converse without saying much that gives them away .	1
yet this film , not as rewarding as his others , still has the style of the director's later works , plus the same themes of graphic violence , a laconic hero , and the thrill of gunfights galore .but this scene was shot in a shoddy way , as it was hard to comprehend that the two gangs were so stupid that they would so easily believe that the stiffs they were fighting over were real .in this western parody , there's some humor behind all the choreographed violence and there's also a passable ennio morricone's score to instill a sense of melodrama .	1
this last incident is the violent note on how the film abruptly ends .the film plays as an allegory , and has a certain strength in its story telling .by the film's end , there's not much difference between the two families as the fight for survival brings everyone down to the level of a beast .	1
there's a quiet brilliance about this melancholy chamber piece , that is much enhanced by the artistic cinematography of nino gaetano martinetti .it's a film for those who appreciate oddities in filmmaking and are not deterred by the slightness of the story or the slow way it gets to where it's going .	1
howard hughes originally entitled it " the man he found , " but on second thought felt the red-menace presented a film with a more modern impact for audiences .of course , the story of a commie town made up of ex-nazis prospering in the middle of america is hard to swallow , but as sheer entertainment value this one somehow works .it's directed by the very capable auteur , william cameron menzies , the noted art director whose talents greatly enhanced films such as gwtw .	1
a solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir , but one that comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind .sutherland's performance is devilishly demonic , and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a very scary character who gets under our skin .but , nevertheles , i still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a brain , a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced with bitter irony .	1
german-born director dominik moll's second feature , a comic thriller in french , is more like a chabrol than a hitchcock film , though a comparison to hitch's " strangers on a train " is a reasonable one .the film's virtues are : the great acting job by lopez , it is accomplished by slowly allowing us to see how really deranged his character is ; the twists in the story that make it hard to guess what comes next , which gives us a bit of a shock at what is taking place as the story carefully builds toward its ironic ending ; plus , there's the attempt to explain why harry's so obsessed with michel , which gives us an intellectual reason to enjoy the film .it is a frightening tale , but it is done in such a humorous manner that you might not realize how twisted it is until you start making a body count .	1
german-born director michael haneke ( " funny games " / " 71 fragments of a chronology of chance " ) continues to make fascinating and diverse films about morality .code unknown is a film marked by its documentary style of filmmaking , as it attempts to look in a realistic way at the immigration of people from all over the world to paris .there's an inherent violence in western europe and there's a mixture of races that can easily be seen in the street scenes , the filmmaker tries to see how a modern european city in the midst of such population changes for its white country handles itself .	1
the director , frank oz ( " bowfinger " ) , a onetime muppeteer whose main body of work has been comedy , deserves credit for keeping the action suspenseful and the long scenes without dialogue interesting .it leaves no messages and no unnecessary violence , but it holds one's attention for the two hours it plays and afterwards you will remember this one as a pretty good heist flick that had three notable actors in it who performed the proper nuances called for by the script .the film proves to be a solid effort , but it lacks the imagination and moody darkness of the human spirit to take it to a melville level in noir caper flicks .	1
warning : spoiler in next paragraph .what ray does very well is make this into a love story , one that is movingly real as it is not corny or filled with clich ?the dark , expressionist photography and the love between these two in such dark settings gives this very ordinary story a poetical elegance and makes it a memorable film .	1
the film reaches its climax after several plot twists when there's a challenge between rhadini and zodiac , which charlie asks lewis's paper to sponsor .this wasn't a tough one to figure out who did it , but the story was a seamless one .it was a fun film , and one also got a chance to see the san francisco version of the 1939 world's fair .	1
a very entertaining charlie chan episode , though the way charlie gets the killer seems far-fetched and the killer's reason had to be explained by charlie because nothing in the film would indicate his reason .this film had a good circus atmosphere , lots of charm to it , and the suspects did a good job of looking guilty .	1
the studio heads of 20th century fox were most pleased with the appealing toler , as the film proved to be a box-office success .the film emphasized the goofiness of the characters more than paying attention to the detective story , but the warm feeling the story had was very satisfying .by the end the film successfully combines the zany comic antics with an exciting detective yarn , though purists of this series might not be that appreciative of all the comedy antics biting into the suspense .	1
it has a spooky atmosphere , a lot of plot twists , a fast-pace , and is fun to watch .there are many characters ( though there are too many to develop anything about them ) , many suspects , and there is a daffiness about this episode that is endearing .if you disregard all the holes in the story , then you should find this one to be a refreshing thriller .	1
the story unfolds like a routine charlie chan mystery , except the plot is well-executed .a solid action episode , featuring a chase through the paris sewers .	1
this is the film noir that made alan ladd a hot star after many years as a struggling actor .the film's terse dialogue , atmospheric dark shots in the freight yards and the snappy presentation of a very slight story when added on to alan ladd's menacing and laconic performance , made this a solid example of what film noir is supposed to be like .it helped establish a number of conventions and character types for this genre .	1
it is mixed messages like that from ford that have always made me wary of him , and despite how layered in complexity the plot and character development this western is and how tight frank nugent's rich script is in pointing out traditional army customs for those who gave their lives in defending america's frontiers--it is still a film that loves war and finds killing to be necessary .these social rituals seem to be just as important as learning how to shoot a rifle .as in all ford westerns , there are his stock characters and scenes devoted to comic humor about the irish being heavy drinkers and gallant fighters .	1
the film also handles a love story , as this bleak look at inner-city life puts everyone's feet to the hot coals .this ambitious painting of a desperate city and its fragile people , often makes salient points and just as often leaves us overhearing conversations without going further with the story .it varies from being like a soap opera to at times offering some very touching dramatic moments .	1
the film is marvelously acted by anjelica huston , who received an oscar nomination for best actress .it's a film that doesn't leave you with much to think about afterwards , but while it played its grit and pulp qualities shine in the darkness .the film could have been better served with a more spirited actress than bening , who's best asset is her body .	1
there is a sense of doom that all the main characters share , as they also share a sense of mixing violence with sex .lewis has created a nasty film noir , where all the characters are sullied by their peculiar sexual habits .the film was raw , a visually unblemished drama about violence and pain .	1
french director eric rohmer's third film is a coming-of-age story , comically looking at the human condition .the beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves and how tense it gets when love and desire become the main topics that are burning in these very ordinary characters' minds .rohmer does it without a strong plot but by his ability to have the characters play out who they are in a realistic way , letting their words and actions become examples of how they really are .	1
it's a slow-moving visual piece , setting a bleak moody atmosphere as it touches on voyeurism and misplaced love and obsessions and childhood abuse .it mainly holds one's interest because the story is so oddly told and all the characters seem to have dark sides ready to burst open at any time .its best feature comes by way of polish cinematographer slawomir idziak , who uses his noted method of filtered filming to great advantage here to capture the angst of the characters and their dark love life .	1
a very solid crime thriller shot in semi-documentary style .its story is of the formulaic kind , but because it was so smoothly executed and the pace was so fluid the episodic saga had a natural flow to it .lewis , the action scenes are brought about with the tension always building .	1
the story might be slight , but the acting by tritignant is just right and the action scenes keep coming and are perfectly executed .scheider also stands out in a supporting role .this flick is all about shootouts and quirky character portrayals , like the one of the housewife talking nonstop to the press about her ordeal and eating up the fact that she's on tv .	1
a more conventional and not as absorbing remake of mystery of the wax museum , 1933 , made with the gimmick of 3-d ( used in a fun way with novelty shots of a barker batting paddleballs in your face and a murderer jumping seemingly out at the audience ) .he wanted to make the museum more commercial by displaying a chamber of horrors , but jarrod is only interested in creating real-life beauty from historical figures such as marie antoinette and joan of arc .it seemed to languor at points of its story , and its grand guignol characterization was too often wasted by touristy tours of the museum .	1
it's still a superior film noir , with a meaningful social conscience theme .the grimness of this tale is certainly something the director understood , and for most of the film that shows .the mood of the film is best captured in the capable hands of bob surtees' eloquent black and white photography .	1
a great low-budget heist film noir .perennial losers in filmdom , elisha cook , jr .and stafford repp , fit right in to this plot .	1
a messenger gives andrews a note marked very important , but when opened it is of trivial concern .but there's the usual twist in plot to catch you by surprise as to who the gang leader is .it made for a very entertaining film , a solid charlie chan vehicle even though there's less detective work done in this chan episode than in others .	1
it was a well-executed , action-packed film noir , co-directed and acted by edmond o'brien .	1
an atmospheric , thrilling whodunit , that is full of surprises , is fast-paced , and is well-acted .but the case puzzles him as all the clues so easily point to brent , it's as if the ex-con has been framed .	1
this worked , making for a crafty production , mainly because it left much of the horror scenes to the viewer's imagination .hammer studio also exploited the x rating it received , which meant only those over 18 could attend , as it launched a massive ad campaign which brought in the crowds to find out why such a rating and also by making the x part of the film's title--the quatermass xperiment , it kept the public's attention on its ad campaign .it was an easy film to watch , as it had its creative moments in the dark .	1
this solid western was the only film roy huggins ever directed , as he went on to do tv work creating the maverick series and later on the rockford files .the tense film becomes a character study in bravery , cowardice , innocence , greed , and romance .the film is made potent be scott's austere presence and the dry wit that runs through the script .	1
a top-notch adventure yarn that criss-crosses the globe in the mid-1930s .a solid film that's high on entertainment value , even though it's a conventional work .	1
it's not clear which man she's with , but neither shows much interest in her .the marriage has been a strained one , without much affection or love on liz' part for fred .the film has an intangible intensity about it that elevates its melodramatic story and makes all the main characters hopeless victims of their circumstances that they can't change .	1
it seemed contrived and the film spent too much prison time , as it said everything it had to say about the dehumanizing effect jail has in its opening shot when she was booked and everything else seemed reduntant .i find it hard to believe that was an uplifting scene as much as it was one that put an exclamation point on the situation , visually indicating that things are still tenuous for the family and even though they have gone over one terrible hurdle and are perhaps psychologically stronger because of it--they are still not out of the dark .nevertheless , this is still a high quality drama , especially recognizing sigourney weaver's tour de force performance of a complex woman who is a little off-kilter .	1
she was also very funny auditioning for an advil spot which she doesn't get , as behind the humor it shows how being rejected is part of the business but it is very difficult not to take it as something personal .the film does a savage job dissecting the thirst there is for fame , in a storyline that is very much new yorkish in attitude and spirit .it might not be all new material and the characters do grow somewhat weary after a fast start but , all things considered , it was surprisingly a lot of fun .	1
this was a revolution the director was a supporter of , but has now gotten into trouble with the censors because of his film's contents .the film was unique , honest , raw , and daring .makhmalbaf shows a great passion for dealing with the ironies of modern iran .	1
he is serious , stable , and straightforward , and sounds a lot like what women want in guy , but he says that is what they say they want , but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly , going after them just for the sex .though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him , especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt , which in his lingo , is an ugly dog , by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave .this film might be upsetting to some , but it is a fresh look at an old problem , and its aim is readily accomplished , as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary .	2
this film challenges our credibility , it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times , telling us secrets that may or may not be true .it also enlightens us that seberg's stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that time , but is now acceptable , making her a trend setter .this is a clever film , immensely satisfying and enjoyable ; and , fortunately , the director casts jean in a favorable light , she seems to deserve that .	2
so goes the theme of this dark comedy , meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with , in a film that features a pedophile rapist ( dylan ) , a murderer ( camyrn ) , an obscene caller ( hoffman ) , a masturbator ( read ) , a russian immigrant thief ( jared ) , and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos , as solondz's morbid sense of humor turns to new jersey's suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race .the audience i saw this film with , were mostly williams college students and faculty , and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it , where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and , in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story , he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters .this is a very solid film , that is well-acted , that is understandably not for everyone , yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu , and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line , this is still a powerful film , one deserving of attention and intelligent critique , one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art , even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told .	2
writer-director/acting star-artist , takashi kitano , has broken ground from traditional films , taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film , that sways between the two extremes , and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states , fireworks is a cross between ozu's late spring and don siegel's dirty harry .the narrative is told in flashbacks , so any part of nishi's life could pop up on the screen , and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding , deceptively turns out to be much more than that , even as nishi gets revenge on the yakuma's who did this to his friend , unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen .as far as i am concerned , i prefer ozu , i am more taken with his intellect and perspective , but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to , as i found this volatile film to be something special , but something i can't completely comprehend because i don't really know what he is trying to say , as if that really matters .	2
the scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way , as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have , and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance .no matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be , it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level .this is not a flawless picture , but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with one's more tender feminine side .	2
adeptly uncovering the need for positive relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace , which might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world .and even though , no smug answers were given as how to accomplish this , one does have choices ; at least , you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation , and not just marking time and staying put on a job that bores you .this movie definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about , and even if it said it in a low voice , its message can be heard above the idle chatter in the office , if you are tuned in to the right cubicle .	2
there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane , as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film's morality play .the result of all the trio's bungling , is that things are no longer simple for them , as greed and their extended version of the american dream , but this time earned the too easy way , via a suitcase full of money found in the snow , becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility , as all their character flaws become magnified , and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found .raimi did a superb visual job , carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains , a difficult task to do , but one that he succeeds in without question .	2
this was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow , not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes , but because i didn't have a full knowledge of what taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame , therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events , didn't always connect with me , as well as it should have .but he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children , enjoying a rich childhood , growing up with many pleasant memories .what is beautiful about the film is its lushness , the sunny colors it evokes , giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise , and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to , like the softness of the rain falling , his father sitting so nobly by his desk , grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is .	2
chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before , to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle , to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship , and how money is such a psychological part of one's mindset .gal is a pip , a pleasure to see on screen ; a character nonpareil , played to perfection , someone who , despite his small part , you will remember long after seeing the film .but if you think you got where the story is going now , you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way , because chabrol is going to town with this thriller , twisting and turning at the movement of every julie sexy wiggle .	2
kitano , the director and star of this gangster actioner , has created a visually stunning , original and spellbinding depiction of stylized gang fights , ambushes , and assorted mayhem .kitano the actor , keeps an impassive facial expression throughout the movie , as he toys with his guns at play and for real , in a performance that wavers between a sensibility and an insensibility toward life , as violence though not glorified , nevertheless is what is fascinatingly portrayed by his unwillingness , in the end , to be perceived any other way .but it was done so stylishly well , that it was , indeed , intriguing to behold , leaving the viewer with much doubt about who kitano really is supposed to be , aside from his hubris as a gangster , and , his mixed outbursts of violent outward behavior and contemplative inner mood swings .	2
there are so many wonderful performances , that it is difficult to say which one is the best , but the russell crowe , dumb tough guy , muscle man cop , takes the cake as far as i am concerned , it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across , as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing , as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information .cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief , with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop , who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you .police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry , even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation .	2
but since this story is mostly a psychological thriller , we are caught in the web of nolte's very compelling characterization , as he is someone who puts us into his shoes , so that we can't help seeing what a tormented person he is , and are really unsure for the time being whether a crime was committed or not , until by the film's end , then everything seems to come into place , and we realize how far gone wade has become .creating a portrait of how a dysfunctional family is , without being trite about it , is not that easy to accomplish , especially since this kind of subject matter is old news by now .but this film accomplished that by creating an edgy mood piece , that has to be watched carefully , because it is filled with plenty of jewels for those who are willing to dig them out in the dark spaces they are to be found in , where one man's plight becomes something that can be so universally felt .	2
whatever opinion you might have about von trier's telling of the myth , you can agree that his version of it , is definetly a deeply felt emotional experience , one that went to the heart of the matter in terms of feeling the agony of what a woman who has lost touch with herself because of her pride , is going through .the only difference is that from dreyer's style of simplicity in filmmaking , we can feel the pains ourself , we didn't need it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements .he came very close to turning me off , as i was beginning to suspect that these scenes didn't have to be that explicit in all its morbid details , the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one , seemed to me , to be exploitive and incredulous , as well as unnecessary .	2
what highlights this film and makes it propelled on a high octane level , is the bravura physical performance of ian mckellen , whose presence on screen is gigantic as a swish personality , much like a few other great performances accomplished recently about gifted artistic and intellectual english queers , such as derek jacobi as francis bacon in love is the devil and john hurt's performance of a fictionalized stuffy professor in love and death on long island .for all its wonderful performances and charm and probative look into the gay hollywood world , this is not a very important film , in the sense that it has little to say about the creative experience but a lot to say about how a queer man can manuever his way around the hollywood of the past , as long as he didn't make a big show out of his sexual predilections .condon has very ably directed a likable and witty film on a very low budget , that makes its subject seem much greater than it is , it is as if jimmy whale invited us over for some iced tea and cucumber sandwiches and he told us a few things about himself and the filming of his frankenstein movie before he got tired-and-all , so all we had left to ponder was the materialism and memories he was surrounded by , and how tired and painful life has become for him , as he wishes for a mercy killing at the hands of clayton , but since he couldn't bring that about , he instead jumps into his pool of seduction and drowns himself .	2
the special effects for this low-budget film are surprising well-done .i loved the explanation given for what god is : an invisible force we fear , and in our vanity , we try to make it human .all you have to remember about this film , is that what you have seen , is all that there is to see , there are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings for you to ponder .	2
this one has a reflective mood and a quiet sparseness to it , that gives its lonely characters a chance to either grow as the story develops or for them to become clearer about who they are and what they are doing .but it does offer a lure for foreign and american visitors to see how the free wheeling , capitalist country , they imagine america to be , operates , when it lets its puritanical hair down .it gives me great delight to see the casino get ripped off , as john works his $150 into $2 , 000 worth of credit and a free room and amenities .	2
the film does a marvelous job of giving us a feel about life in the early part of the 20th century and how resolute some genuine seekers of the truth were in carrying on the arguments of religious orthodoxy versus scientific reality .one of the problems with the film , that took away some of its luster , was that charles acted in such a one dimensional manner , jumping from non-believer to a firm believer in fairies in such a rapid time , that it was hard to fathom what was going on in his head .this is something western mystics might find easier to believe than others ; but , in any case , one seeking the truth still must choose which spiritual conditions to aspire to , and this film presents one such option .	2
that might be because the film goes off on so many different directions-- from murder to counter-culture romance-- before it zeroes into the hippy drug dealing scene as it evolved from the '60s to what it is today , which makes it a too controversial topic for sony to know how to advertise and release to theaters .its highly animated story is both funny and suspenseful , with a good deal of its plot made up of the kind of material reserved for a sociologist who is writing a treatise on why certain types of people must be outlaws ; the director's aim was to make a take-off on the treasure of the sierra madre theme , but this time with a stoned-out foursome lured by the possibility of making 3 million dollars through growing and dealing marijuana .this is a well-written and acted and directed film , that is often disarmingly brilliant , getting right in the face of an outlaw lifestyle that is both dangerous and beautiful .	2
what is going on inside her , is seen through the marvelously constructed dream sequences of her in africa- as a griot , an african musical storyteller , chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs- that are very emotionally received by her .the imponderable emotions of love are caught in the music , the stunning visual spectacle of the film , and in the quietude of their personalities .the up and down career of bertolucci , is up again after this less than epic film ( actually made for an hour tv program , but lengthened for the sake of a feature movie ) .	2
winton hoch , the cinematographer , won an oscar for the visually memorable mesas and haunting loneliness of the monument valley landscape , which was used as the film's location sites .to add color and more sentimentality to the story , there is the theme song of the yellow ribbon , played countless times , either to the immense pleasure of most viewers or to some , to grate on their nerves .but if you don't , you can still be swept away by the eloquence of the film and its call for some kind of majesty of action one should have , in this beautiful , god created country , that ford believes has room in it for everyone who acts civilly .	2
there is something about this chic look at modern english society- one that is filled with wanton sex , drugs , and violence- that is more frightening than all the mayhem , perversities , muggings , and rapes it shows on screen .the most frightening part of the film , was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement , are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are .the jargonistic language used ( called nadsat- an onomatopoetic combination of english , russian , and slang ) made for a most arresting film , one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems .	2
fast-paced action and witty one-liners , allow this hitchcock-like story to be both amusing and thrilling .and the surprise ending is a beaut , which should catch you off-guard , as you will most likely be misled and unable to guess who the murderer is .a real delightful and snappy film , featuring mystery , humor , snappy dialogue , and a great surprise ending .	2
jimi hendrix was too stoned to adequately perform " foxy lady . "the obnoxious announcer , rikki farr , goes so far as calling the crowd " pigs , " wavering back and forth between conjoling and chiding them , with neither strategy doing anything but creating more bad feelings .the crowd shots showed rampant hashish smoke and psychedelic drugs being ingested , nudity , the potential for a riot , and talk among the concert goers that this was a just a " money " thing , as the feelings of idealism or another woodstock , which was only one year earlier , seemed like ancient history .	2
the noir look of the film is enhanced by it being shot at the actual location of the incident .this taut , well-told story , is suspenseful in the noir tradition of showing dark shadows and setting a dark mood .the acting is superb , screenwriter richard murphy received an academy award nomination , and elia kazan , in his afterthought comments about the film , mentioned that he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail .	2
i felt like i was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant oscar wilde comedy/drama costume play turned movie , and i must confess , i enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of it , as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley of epigrams .for the elite audience that attended the play , oscar wilde , after mocking the english nobility would , at least , leave them with a thinly disguised compliment , by telling them no one can be ideal .writer/director oliver parker ( othello ) has created a lighthearted film for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating .	2
somehow or other the world has to receive the message from the tibetans , who are undergoing at the hands of their suppressors , the chinese communists , a policy of genocide that will probably continue unchecked unless something is done to stop it .if you are seeing this film to be entertained , you are in the wrong movie house , though the exquisite natural beauty of the country and the entrancing holy city of lhasa- and its potala ( the largest buddhist structure in the world ) - offer quite a lot of sights to behold .it is easy to see why china doesn't want the truth about its human rights violations known , or about the murders it commits and acts of brutality , and its spy system and systematic control over its subjects , or how it refuses to allow the people to even have pictures of the dalai lama in their homes , arresting those that do .	2
what works very well for coppola , is the over-all mood he captures of how the inner city kids react to their identity crises .i'm on the side of those who liked this emotionally wrought , stylized film , adapted from a novel by s .to the film's credit , it was not a glossy look at the kids : it had the good sense to stay true to its theme without just blaming society for the problems presented .	2
it is what fills the mind with light ; it is a spiritual happening that is the most powerful thing in the world .the hero is likable , somewhat courageous and scholarly , a person of integrity and loyalty , and is the only hope for poland's future .that is certainly an arguable statement , as even the protagonist in the story eventually realizes not everything can be settled by rational arguments .	2
what the film clearly shows , is that the bulk of the iraqi people , not the inner circle of the dictator , seem to be bearing the brunt of the war's dire consequences .the actors are brilliantly cast and make up for the lack of depth of their characters by giving engaging performances : george clooney is both heroic and devilish , presenting a commanding stature for his authoritative role .i feel that the filmmaker has caught the mood of most of the soldiers , who don't understand the politics of the war and just want to go home in one piece , of the career brass who are in it for promotions , the media reporters who want to not only get the story but be the first one to get it , and the politicians who can find a rational for whatever they do .	2
this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters .mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end .his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away .	2
all that he knows , is that he just wants her physically , that he feels her inside his gut ; and , that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought possible , is precisely what gives impetus to this gothic romance .her performance is the key one ; it is the one that propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love .she is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found in this backward place and the passion she feels from baines , as it seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her .	2
the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors' placement and camera movement .what weakness' there are to the story , come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place-- but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow .the film's ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus , not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring .	2
instead , it is to their credit that we get interesting and * convincing * characters from colonial times who seem to have leapt right out of the real story from irving , when in fact most of them were newly created .the film is a triumph of black and white and shades of grey ( only to be disrupted by the end by that horrible sunlight ) and mesmerizing visual images and effects .johnny depp plays a wonderfully amusing ichabod crane ; and while christina ricci was decent in her role , i still maintain that she was miscast because she looks too much like a child .	2
caligari , " and most reflective of a kafkaesque type of story depicting a man trapped by absurd circumstances and his mistrust of society , as the film sets a nightmarish tone .the film runs its course with alternating moods of exhileration and tedium , but proves itself to be visually stimulating overall , with every scene showing the contrasts between the light and dark of life .you can look at it as a visionary poem or as an allegory on life , either way , the film is original and stimulating , if one can take the very slow pace of its camera work and its tenor of dull melancholy and its inconclusiveness into proper consideration .	2
ulmer , it is possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it , on the edgy words of the protagonist , who wonders to himself how , " fate could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all , " and not be laughed at as pretentious dialogue .what is most amazing , though , is that this film was shot in six days in a poverty row studio on an extremely low budget , without an attempt to get any location shots for a story that centers around a cross-country hitchhiking trip , and yet it remains gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors .ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study , that plays like a mesmerizing confession , as the hero has the intangible quality of innocence going for him , which adds a seductive quality to his character for those in the audience , such as me , who can appreciate his natural inclination not to trust the authorities , even when that seems to be the most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in .	2
alvin's eyesight is so poor , that he doesn't have a driver's license , he walks with a cane , has a bad hip , has emphysema , and is as stubborn as a mule ; therefore , even though , it doesn't make too much sense to travel the way he does , no one can talk him out of it .yet , lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she was becoming less confused about what to do , and by having her symbolically show that she understood what alvin told her to do .but , in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about small-town america and its elderly , it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldn't delve deeper and get more out of the story , as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such small-town conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelled-up , the people seem so unintellectual , and the places visited so dull , notwithstanding , how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency .	2
i only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it plays much like many a classical western , but is shot in the '60s style of " point blank , " and is scripted by lem dobbs , most probably , for the entertainment value it provides .steven sodergergh ( sex , lies , and videotape/kafka/schizopolis/out of sight ) has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but offer promises of much more .therefore style over substance isn't all that bad a message for this intensely shot nouveau-noir work , that seemed to be saying something like that or maybe it's just that the king's english , even when spoken by a common criminal in a rich cockney accent , sounds so worthwhile , that i have been so duly conditioned to believe that about the english language , that i would listen keenly to anyone who spoke like that and believe i was listening to something philosophical .	2
he seems to be interested in just surviving , there is no political savvy about him , as he seems unconcerned about the reasons for the korean war and what it means .this is a beautifully done b&w action film , one of the most powerful war stories ever made .the film is taut and grim , and is excellently paced , holding one's interest throughout .	2
it features a unique soundtrack that is mostly made up of constant shrill sounds that might destroy your inner peace ( clangs , hissings , whistles , street noise , etc . ), but it also has a lovely little song tract , sung by the deformed lady in the radiator ( laurel near ) , with the catchy lyric , " everything is fine in heaven , " as it is meant to offer hope to the despondent hero of this dream , who is probably thinking about suicide as an answer to his problems .this is a film not made for strictly entertainment value , and to get the viewer involved in thinking about what all these symbols mean , requires some imagination on their part to interpret the dream .	2
looking at those who are pinheads , limbless , dwarves , a bearded lady and her baby bearded girl , twins physically attached to each other by the hip , and the assorted other real freaks used in this film , has its initial shock to those not used to seeing the abnormal , but that should soon wear off and what remains is how sympathetic the audience becomes to the freaks , who are part of a travelling circus sideshow .i would have to think because of the way the film was cut , the characters of phroso and his lady friend venus , were never developed and remain dry portrayals .and by the way , browning did not exploit the freaks , as the critics in the 1930s said , he made the normal people who were intolerant to be the grotesque ones .	2
it has a raw power in it that a noir film commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly onscreen , even if the scene was changed from the one in greene's novel .richard attenborough's manic performace as a psychopathic , androgynous character , who had violent mood swings , was pulsatingly brilliant .his sadomasochistic relationship with the naive rose , coupled with dark shots of the seamy side of brighton , plus the expressionistic studio shots , gave the film a raw energy that makes it more powerful than the usual gangster film .	2
the reward the viewer gets for sitting through the long and highly structured but at times confusing film , that tries to picture life as being a matter of coincidences , is how brilliant the individual skits were and how fine the acting was .but that can't begin to explain how penetrating a human drama this is and how acutely aware the young director is of the people's misery and heartaches he highlights .but anderson offers more meat in his character's parts than did altman and more finesse in telling his story , allowing his actors to expand their roles more .	2
john alton is an excellent cinematographer , with noir films being his specialty , as his camera knows how to capture that shadowy world of half-lit images and dark background scenery .the photography is electric , consisting of low angle shots and reflections of light coming in from the open window , giving the scene a naturally eerie look and a depth perception creating the illusion of how far apart the men have now become in their lives , as the light from the candelabra highlights the shadows in the room .claire's voiceover narration gives the film some added chills , and the three main characters become studies in emotional deprivation , giving the film an added depth in its character study .	2
has made an articulate film , one that goes over territory such as abortion , incest , murder , and forging records , and asks the viewer to use their intelligence in seeing what is right or wrong .yet some movie reviewers , including the esteemed roger ebert , the most widely read critic in america , find that the theme of the film is muddled .the story had a natural rhythm to it , and the relationship between caine and maguire wasn't contrived , but seemed to generate its own energy ; it seemed genuinely affecting .	2
the iverson ranch at chatsworth , a movie site rented out to all studios , was dressed up and used for the technicolor production of rko's rancho notorious , giving the film its artificial look .nevertheless , lang's western overcame that obstacle and today is considered as one of the strongest and the most unusual westerns of its kind , a film that could not be dragged down by the bickering between lang and dietrich during the filming , or by the low budget ordered by howard hughes which kept most of the work in the studio , or by hughes' taking lloyd gough's name off the credits because he failed to testify in the huac's hollywood witchhunt .this was a ludicrous concept to believe , as if one expected the bandits to be honest with her and give her the exact amount to stay , but it is fair to say , that reality was not one of the film's strong points .	2
but , nonetheless , he has come-up with a first-class melodramatic thriller , very much in the noir spirit , by complementing guffey's photographs of shadowy figures and a dark city scene , with long craning shots , quick-darting movements of the heroine's nervous actions , and a style of camerawork that is not necessarily suited for a noir film , using an encircling camera , giving the scene an airy feel of possible freedom .bennett and mason give sterling performances , pulling out all the nuances of their roles .a very engaging thriller , every bit as good as the more respectable films the classy director has made .	2
a neat noir thriller that has a slight variation on the " double indemnity " theme , this time it is the guy who is the seducer .as for the contemptuous van heflin , who really has a disregard for others , his love for keyes was real but not enough for him , he had to also have the superficial material things of life to satisfy his weak ego .these two stars gave superb performances in this arresting thriller that is scripted with a social conscience and a taut sense of reality .	2
cecilia roth , the wonderful argentinian-born actress , is the focal point of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of motherhood .this film could be enjoyed solely for its bright orange , red and yellow patterns , giving the eye a startling light show to feast on , as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty to another .that is not an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary references to it , despite the differences i have with his approach to the characters and their development .	2
the film looks as if it is being shot in real time , as stoker awaits in the dressing room , exchanging good-natured barbs with the other boxers present and listening to their nervous chatter .the crowd was made up of an assortment of fans , some there to wager , others to eat and enjoy themselves , some getting a kick out of the mayhem seen , and a blind man- having his pal give him a detailed description of the fight- just loving the violence .wise brought in former boxing professional john indrisano to make sure the choreographed fight scenes were realistic .	2
leos carax's inspiration for this film was jean vigo's masterpiece " l'atalante " ( 1934 ) .the story is a quiet one , an imitation of the life and sounds of all the things happening in their surroundings .we observe the madness of their lives and how love is so difficult to comprehend but is the only thing that is out there that can't be taken away from them , that it becomes the rationale of the film .	2
katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have .to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook .his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised .	2
there is also a dark side to life that david lynch ( eraserhead/the elephant man/dune ) wants to show you in the underbelly of normalcy and that's what gets explored in this fantastic , original american film of his .for those looking to criticize it these might be some reasons to do so : it relies on shock to tell its forgettable story , it fails to develop character emphasizing style instead , and the acting seems more staged than spontaneous .i believe that is what happened in this film , and though its motivations are ambiguous , it does hit some kind of sore spot for respectable society to consider , without turning up its nose at all the revolting things this story brought to the surface .	2
it is shown from the soldier's perspective , how war dehumanizes one and survival becomes a basic instinct .it is a visual film that explores the reality of the actual war , told from the soldier's point of view .the director's one fault , was that he couldn't resist feeding the audience with his opinion , not able to rely completely on the visual impact of his story to do the job .	2
the original film had a more ironical and less standard ending than this version .but this is a highly appetizing film and a more attractive one to view .granger gives a commanding macho performance and the vistas are delightfully magnicent , which should be enough of a reason for seeing this version , also .	2
it is a technically superior work , making up for a thin plot with plenty of lively musical scores and dance numbers , and a constant barrage of witty dialogue .the songs include the following : 'a shine on your shoes , ' 'dancing in the dark , ' 'that's entertainment , ' 'by myself , ' my favorite number about triplets who do not like each other- 'triplets , ' 'new sun in the sky , ' 'i guess i'll have to change my plans- the highlight of this number is a soft-shoe by astaire and buchanan , ' 'louisiana hayride , ' 'i love louisa , ' and an eight-minute dream number that is the climax of the film-- a jazz-dance spoof on mickey spillane's 'girl hunt , ' with cyd showing off her long dancing legs as a femme fatale in a smoky barroom and delivering a very sexy routine in a sequined red dress and black mesh tights .the marton scenarists write a broadway show for tony hunter and get the pretentious jeffrey cordova to direct it .	2
chema recognizes that it is a digital camera xt-500 used , by noting the grainy quality of the film .ngela for being so aloof , for not learning much in film school and for not being able to observe the minute details in filmmaking .this slick suspense story works very well on capturing her fear and following the trail to the killer , but fails to be convincing in showing how the public's prurient interest in violent smut is the reason filmmaker's make such degrading films .	2
this odets' work was originally performed as a neo-realist broadway play in 1941 , with tallulah bankhead in the stanwyck role .she can't resist anymore and tries to make a relationship with earl work , fed-up that jerry is so dull .everything about these characters and their alienation seemed natural , something that was grounded by lang's showing them at work , never cutting them off from all the travails they were going through just to exist .	2
it's a film that sympathetically sides with the rebellious youths and their befuddled parents , and it doesn't even demonize the police .all these well-off kids ride to school together in this open car , acting loud and stupid , proud to be dumb americans .for all its aging and the changing mores of the times and the ever-increasing complexities of modern youth , this creaky film still has a rawness about it , something that is intangible , that gets into your spine and brings out a chill or two , that tells you this dramatization was real .	2
stage fright is a hardly frightening but , nonetheless , laudable movie , that features hitchcock's droll humor and his perfection in regards to set arrangements .this is a mystery tale that is not too difficult to figure out who the guilty party is , but the fun comes in playing along with the man on the run theme and to follow along with his love stricken wannabe actress maiden heroine and her eccentric family , and take-in the mae west-like performance from the incomparable marlene dietrich , as charlotte inwood , a stage actress/chanteuse with a rather vulgar personality and an odd sense of humor , who rules the london stage world as if she were a pampered peacock with fangs .this film , the second one hitchcock has done in england since his return there from america , is one of the master's most subtle and sharpest comic efforts .	2
this film is a visual masterpiece , capturing the frenetic pace of life in the city and the faces of sorrow on the poor ; it paints an unsentimental picture of a place that is a living hell .but it is not a masterpiece storywise , as its storyline was rambling , laying no specific blame for what is happening on the local government or for that matter , on anyone , only implying how rotten the western influence is .still , this is one powerful film , filled with relentless and disturbing visualizations , whose poetic voice comes from the inside of the director and is strong and boiling over with metaphorical emotion .	2
it is a black comedy , acclaimed for its stellar performances , especially by rod steiger as christopher gill , the psychologically warped killer , with a severe mother fixation , who uses a number of disguises to commit the murders and performs the murders as if he was on-stage , being only natural , considering that he is an accomplished broadway actor and well-known theater owner , and the son of a great actress .steiger calls him the next day and offers to become segal's telephone confidant , but tells him , " remember , i am smarter than you are . "it was difficult not to find this witty film funny and its romantic subplot equally charming .	2
taxman is a wonderfully played cynical , offbeat , low-key thriller with comic undertones , also exhibiting plenty of local atmosphere and human intensity .they both can't help it , they have personalities that rub people the wrong way , even if they don't mean to be annoying and are supposedly intelligent , they are still kept at the bottom-level of their jobs .the film had many endearing qualities : the cast was magnificent ; the novice cop was an unforgettable character ; the taxman was even more unforgettable ; elizabeth berkley is a beautiful sight for sore eyes and her russian accent was as good as pate from zabars ; and , the story , though thoroughly routine , was presented with a certain grittiness that elevated it to the level of those el trains running above the brighton beach russian community .	2
it makes the most of its tale by its vivid dream sequences and the masterly holding off of its inevitable findings until its conclusion , as it relies on the viewer becoming overwhelmed with curiosity to hang on until the end .it is a superbly done suspense yarn relating to what lengths someone will go to find out something that he feels he must know about himself , as this tale is told without the usual horror film special effects .and , bernard-pierre donnadieu is perfectly credible as a self-absorbed psycho , someone who is devoid of passion , as his crime is not sexually motivated even if he seems to only target pretty woman ( he says that he does so because they don't expect to be victims ) .	2
the director is in a playful mood and builds a crime scene around kinky characters , hypocrites , lowlifes , and druggies , as he parodies bourgeois life .the inspector is the focal point of the film and the way he operates is a rough imitation of sherlock holmes .poiret is superb , his dry wit and the persistent way he carries out the investigation , sets the film's laconic tone , setting up the bizarre turn of events in a magnificently comic fashion .	2

it's a virtuous film that after its violent beginning settles down and becomes an amusing and insightful study about a man trying to find himself after spending the last eight years in prison .though imamura paints yamashita's character as being serious and withdrawn , there are comical interludes which make him seem plain daffy .an interesting film , that works most effectively as an introspective study of how to deal with one's anger and love .	2
he speaks in a hesitatingly slow , thick southern drawl , and is a very modest , inward man .ian holm's performance is brilliant and sparkling , one of his best in his long and distinguished career .this cautionary story pictures a city that has changed so much from joe gould's time , that a talented eccentric nowadays should expect to receive no help from a city that is becoming less interested in helping its weirdo artists or its mentally ill , instead turning its attention to more mundane concerns .	2
this is an overlooked noir thriller--shamefully it couldn't get a british film distributor to give it a wide release when it opened .the cynical message inferred , is that one can't change human nature , that sooner or later one will have to make a choice and bend the rules to accomodate who one is .when compared to three recent films about gambling , " casino , " " the rounders " and " reindeer games , " there is no comparison , this one was the more real and pertinent one .	2
it had a well-intentioned liberal message in the face of the time's mccarthy witch hunts , it only lacked an edge to its straightforward rational call for world peace and an end to the nuclear arms race .bernard herrmann's brilliantly haunting musical score aided in capturing the alien atmosphere of the story .it's hard to argue with the rational message delivered , i just wished the film took on the politics of the scientists sleeping in the same bed with the government , who are just as much a detriment to world peace as the xenophobic media and the cowardly bunch of world leaders .	2
it also gave the director a chance to come to hollywood to show off his ability to shoot action films , where he made " in the line of fire " / " air force one " / " perfect storm . "tz weidner , which duplicates the cramped boat down to its grimy details , and provides the film with the proper setting for its intense realism .the crew was made up of sympathetic figures and not cardboard nazis most ww11 films seen from an american perspective portray onscreen for the germans .	2
this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .	2
billy crudup is simply ingenious in this sterling role as the poetic voice of the author , making the internal musings of denis johnson's disjointed surreal stories come to life , not quite like in the book , but in its own cinematic way .the film is divided into chapter headings , which are flashed onscreen , as fh rants on like the stoned out freak he is .it is a film that zig-zags all over the map , with its target being pop culture in america and how one survivor of the drug culture , who is so disarming and real , will have his maddening story breathe life into his messed up junkie veins and give vent to dreams he has that are as relevant as any genuine religious experience .	2
on a personal level , the psychological effects of the war are seen through the conflict between loomis and endore .the sheer black-and-white photography caught the expansive mood of the troops in the battlefield , and its grainy quality helped the viewer see the war in a personalized way , as in the scene where the idealist loomis is fighting for his survival in a hand-to-hand fight with a chinese soldier .there couldn't be a more pronounced statement about the insanity of war than this gritty film offers , as seen mainly through the dead-pan eyes of a psychopath .	2
a strangely intriguing , darkly made psychological allegory based on the late walker hamilton's only novel .the film works its way to a suspenseful but tacky and implausible revenge conclusion , as all its energy seems to have been spent on its fairy tale setup and the relationship between the two kindred spirits .but , nevertheless , this film , if you allowed it to be seen as a proficiently lyrical work , one that is heartfelt and never false , then you can feel the sincerity of it and you can see in the grand shots of bobby's escape to the wilderness , away from civilization , as he earnestly narrates his tale of woe offscreen , how poetical the film is and how it is a modern fairy tale for adults and fans of the cinema that still believe that movies can make them see things again as they did when they were children .	2
all those who testify , tell the truth from their own viewpoint , as some of the dialogue is pleasingly witty and some of the observations made are extremely sharp .the marvelous thing , is that kiarostami can get superb performances from the non-professional actors as well as the professionals , because as sabzian stated during the trial , acting is just being yourself , letting it all come out from the heart .it is also an interesting look at modern iran , its bureaucracy , its class divisions , its high unemployment , and its seemingly fair-minded court system .	2
apple , the ( sib ) ( director : samira makhmalbaf ; screenwriter : mohsen makhmalbaf ; cinematographer : ebrahim ghafouri/mohamad ahmadi ; editor : mohsen makhmalbaf ; cast : massoumeh naderi , zahra naderi , ghorbanali naderi , azizeh mohamadi ; runtime : 85 ; 1998-iran/france ) it is based on a true event and uses the actual family involved in relating this odd but wonderful story , which is told in a wryly humorous manner .this ignorance is bliss tale , a tale with no given solution , seems like it is a documentary , but instead it mixes fact and fiction , as it adds setup fictional pieces to its factual story ; and , this national story in iran , which was widely reported in their media causing a national scandal , plays here with a dazzling sense of wonderment and complexity .it makes a potent statement about women's rights in a country where women are seen as inferior , and it also symbolically calls for more freedom for all people .	2
the family is more complex than a mob family has a right to be , and the philosophical lines they spout , in this slow-moving , almost actionless film for this genre , sometimes seems bizarre but has a strange pull to it , one that keeps you wondering what's going on with these dangerous criminals , as their lives begin to unravel during the funeral .i thought the glue to this film , was walken's mesmerizing performance , who is able to say with a straight face , that the flaw in a criminal's character , is that he is not trustworthy .that is the message ferrara brings with this anti-gangster gangster film , who digresses to talk about other topics such as capitalism and sexual kinkiness , but only in a cursory way .	2
this debut indie film for director steven soderbergh is a stimulating but perverse psychological drama .2 million , deservedly won la palme d'or for best film and the best actor award for james spader .this is a film where sex is always kept as an intriguing mystery and a part of the story that adds spice to the wry humor of the events .	2
delmar daves , the writer/director , has done a more than credible job in catching the tense atmosphere involving the characters and the san francisco locale .parry is never seen , as we only hear his voice for about an hour into the film , seeing a picture of him only in the newspaper as an escapee , as he tells his tale from his subjective viewpoint .the fatalism commonly developed in the internal structures of most noir protagonists , is just not relevant to the bogart character , who ends up in a happy relationship with the one he loves , anyway .	2
first-time director cameron crowe who was to go on and make many successful films ( singles/jerry maguire ) , including his latest " almost famous , " gives his due respect to these teenage characters , whose character are rarely treated in such films in such a plausible human way .that alone is enough to make this a superior film , but besides that , the film was superbly scripted and acted , with tremendous use of the characters interacting in a real way .the important thing here is that everyone was presented in a real way , even the irs agents were given more than one dimension , and therefore it meant something to see how the relationship between the teenage couple developed .	2
the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects .the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed .this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself .	2
it's a small but telling story , more european in flavor than american , but deserving of much praise for its heartening universal human message .but this film has ingrained in it more than merely its inspirational story , it is a film about a culture that is currently being persecuted and threatened with genocide , and the noble tibetan answer is to fight back by being as a human as possible , not resorting to violence , only acting in the most civilized way possible , making their actions , no matter what they are involved in , a moral lesson to the world .if that's all you see about this film , a bunch of kids watching a soccer game on satellite tv , then i think you missed its message in this lifetime .	2
though kitano has strong feelings for them , probably reminded through them of his own unsteady youth , he nevertheless doesn't let them off the hook , showing their many faults and blemishes , and their immaturity and lack of discipline that is needed to succeed .the director is so confidant of what he is doing that the character of shinji shines ever so strongly , despite long periods of him remaining quiet .kitano's unique gift is in his understanding of the troubled youths and in his humorous presentation of them , one that is given with a gently bemused but forgiving look at how the teens do such stupid things as kids .	2
a purely hollywood hokum story of the lycanthropy legend , but done with much gusto and fun .the cast is superb , the atmosphere of an english village with an alpine background setting and plenty of fog and dense woods , gives the film an eerie look .thewolf man " is some kind of special b-movie , it works so well , even if the story is impossible to believe , because of the stellar cast and that there is a modern link between the wolfish desires of the lon chaney character and how society can't help itself today in the same psychologically wolfish way as the wolf man was trapped in .	2
the film is so realistic , probably , because it was written by a senator eugene mccarthy speechwriter jeremy larner , who won the oscar for his original screenplay .it is directed by michael ritchie ( downhill racer ) , who does a good job keeping the film afloat with black humor and tension .he also energizes the apathetic electorate with basically the same tired political rhetoric his opponent is saying , but he has charisma and it somehow sounds fresh coming from his lips .	2
agnes varda's first color film is shot in very warm and pleasing pastel hues , capturing the beautiful french countryside and the ordinary dwellings where the family featured resides .what makes this film somewhat unique , is that jean-claude drouot's real wife and kids portray his movie spouse and offspring .this is a very sensual and visually satisfying film , one that shows how each of the characters is stuck in their own romantic dream-world .	2
spoiler to follow : skip to last paragraph if you don't want to know the details of harry's investigation .this excellently scripted film by alan sharp , captures the mood of the country at the time among many who felt they survived vietnam , the jfk assassination and the white house scandal , but still feel weary and uncertain about the future , as it seems as if no matter what they do or how smart they become , they are still going around in circles .it is sort of like playing the grand master in chess and you know what move to trap him , but you still screw up somehow and lose .	2
an iconoclastic biopic about the adventurous 17th century late-renaissance painter michelangelo merisa da caravaggio , who was born in 1573 and died in 1610 .the baroque artist is superbly played by nigel terry and the story is brilliantly adapted to the screen by english director derek jarman .as a result this is a dark but imaginative look at the artist , one that has weight to it and works very well , which should be more pleasing to art lovers than the general public .	2
the opening scene highlights peckinpah's theme of man's inherent violent nature from childhood and points to the bloodshed that will come in the film's payoff , as he shows a bunch of mexican children poking a stick at a writhing scorpion being devoured by killer ants and of them laughing as they watch .thereby the memorable closing scene , which is a picture of pure violence as an answer to everything , as the generalissimo's men and pike's remaining men shoot it out , leaving no survivors .they don't make violent westerns like this one anymore , but they tried to imitate it many times , but they could never quite capture the spirit that this classic western had .	2
it is superbly acted and photographed , and even if the irwin shaw short story the film is adapted from seems aimless , there is a poignancy that rings true underlining the inscrutability of the characters .since a one-night stand didn't materialize , the boys forget about the nice girls .	2
lewton's fingerprints are all over the literary script that was made into an intelligent , well-crafted and bizarre thriller .it is noirish in attitude and gothic in tone , enhanced by dark shadowy cinematography and mark robson's crisp direction , which brings about a mixture of ominous danger and a feel for the offbeat .when viewed that way , this low-budget film is simply superb , equal to producer val lewton's " cat people " ( 42 ) .	2
if you love snappy dialogue , characters who are insightful , and a healthy sprinkling of sheer playfulness you will find this film an old-fashioned delight , much like the sophisticated comedies of preston sturgess .there is a running gag throughout the film from two stoic yankees , with lines that are pure mamet delights , as these two old-time vermonters who are nonplussed by all the fuss in town over the hollywood people have a dialogue that goes like this : woodchuck #1 : " it takes all kinds . "the film felt more stagy than cinematic , more apish of hollywood's cynicism than not , but that's ok , it still had some bite to it by way of some crisp dialogue and from some well-timed comedy routines .	2
mystery of mr .it is a witty , well crafted thriller , that has a charm to it that sparkles like a diamond .x was remade in 1952 as the hour of thirteen .	2
the story played more like a gimmick than a real love affair , because after their initial encounters , it seemed rather strange that these intelligent people wouldn't be curious to know more about each other , especially since they were developing a certain bond together .and if you add to that the mature script by french novelist and playwright philippe blasband and the classy way frederic fonteyne directed , it is easy to see why the film was so enthralling .it was as if this was a sex lab experiment , an ideal couple was being tested to see if a purely sexual encounter could spark a more intimate relationship .	2
a poignant , original , psychological drama-comedy depicting life among a bunch of disorientated residents in vancouver .the acting is subtle ( babz chula's performance is mesmorizing ) , while , the story , though not reliant on plot , is emotionally strong , showing how all the individuals are tangled up in knots .it was both a sad and funny picture , one that i would highly recommend for those who are not afraid of seeing some very graphic , 'dirty' sexual scenes , that fit the story to a tee .	2
there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .	2
this film offers a literate script and is sensitively directed , it's a brilliant debut as a director for playwright kenneth lonergan ( co-scripted " analyze this ! "the siblings have different personalities and have gone down different roads , and even though there is a strong bond between them , what this restaurant meeting highlights is how different they also are , as this scene brilliantly sets the tense tone for the remainder of the film .this is a superbly acted and subtle work , whose only flaws are in the unbelievable romance between boss and worker and the artificial lovemaking depicted between sammy and her townie boyfriend , both of which had no ring of truth to it .	2
art biopics are rarely successful ventures but this film approaches those high caliber art films , such as jacques rivette's la belle noiseuse and paul cox's vincent : the life and death of vincent van gogh , but falls short by a good country mile due to the film's inability to get a handle on how to tell about the taciturn artist's inner demons in a significant way rather than in the traditional bleak and trite way hollywood films usually illustrate an artist's failings .the strength of the film is in the tour de force performances of both ed harris as the action painter pollock , a role that he is well-suited to play , and marcia gay harden's understated but brilliant performance as his brooklyn-born wife and main supporter , lee krasner .these scenes were brilliantly executed by harris and made the film a labor of love for him .	2
some viwers might consider niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a noir , but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film , whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him , while the femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite .director hathaway does a nice job of crafting the film and exploiting its colorful location , but what he doesn't do that well , is allow the mystery part of the story to gracefully unfold .the last reel plays like an action film , with a strangulation , a kidnapping , a helicopter rescue , and one character doomed to be going over the falls .	2
under john boorman's ( deliverance/hope and glory ) competent direction , the film has air to breathe for its smart storytelling tale and parody .the joke is how readily the americans buy into this unreliable info without thoroughly checking it out , and how this quickly turns into an international disagreement between panama and the u .the directing is impeccable , the acting finely tuned , and the mood it sets is for a thinking man's picture to develop amidst all the comedy .	2
this wonderful documentary on the life of ramblin' jack elliott won the special jury award for artistic achievement at the 2000 sundance film festival .the film's other aim is a loving tribute to his musical accomplishments and his troubadour lifestyle of never settling down .she complains : " the thing is , i can't remember having an actual conversation with my dad . "	2
it's set in modern france though it starts out looking like a romantic 19th century literary work , where its background is a rich , idyllic country setting in normandy of palatial chateaus void of modern traffic .this is a unique film , that has an inexplicable brilliance to it that defies reason and its soap opera melodramatics .but there is an intelligence it has about it that should overcome all doubts about its excesses : as the film goes from showing pierre's change from being a self-indulgent aristocrat to his complete breakdown as a self-indulgent raving lunatic .	2
marzieh meshkini is the wife of noted iranian film director mohsen makhmalbaf .strangely enough , the iranian censors wanted the director to cut this part because they found it too erotic .you can learn more about iran from watching a movie like this one than you can by following the news stories reported by the media .	2
they keep the viewer riveted to the twists in plot as one's perceptions about the case are subject to change , in this excellently conceived australian psychological thriller .what is the truth can only be surmised by the film's end , but enough is revealed so that you think you know the answer .though the film might not be startling or flamboyant it is competently acted , especially by the two main antagonists , hugo weaving and tony martin .	2
love's a bitch is an intricate film noir tale , living up to its tough sounding title .the lost dog sequence seemed too forced and heavy-handed to have much impact ; it was piling up the material girl's misery much too high .rritu's characters are full of life and earthy flaws , and things that are too much for them to comprehend .	2
that this combination avant garde art film and literary period drama is successful in its bold attempt to go where most other filmmakers fear to go , into the labyrinthian world of proust's dying era during the early part of the 20th century and to come away with a work of such dreamlike beauty , is simply an amazing feat .the film is made up of a succession of formal social gatherings in palatial homes through which finely dressed women gossip wearing either brocades or fashionable feathers sticking out of their hair ; while the formally dressed men parade around in the ballroom with the look of contented bulls ; the film's most artistic image is of the men's upturned top hats covering the floor of an ornate waiting room .it's an ambitious project , enhanced by its starry cast , filled with splendid visuals and tidbits from conversations that don't linger long , as the film moves intractably into the poetical .	2
it traces in particular the aspects of women's work and their servitude that covers a 10-year period - from 1951 to 1961 .this is a very pleasing and subtle tale about the strength of the human spirit and the artistic quietude one has when finding peace within one's self .a terrific film , one of tremendous visual beauty , but one that steers clear of any overt political messages .	2
billy crudup plays the wheedling fielding pierce who's stuck in an empty world of deceit , in a political role much like the robert redford character in the candidate .i don't really know how great this film is , but it did catch my attention ; especially , the way gordon was able to get his main characters to act out who they were and struggle to make their life and their love viable , despite the different directions they would have to go to get where they wanted to be .i know i felt very comfortable with jennifer connelly's performance ; i thought it was subtle , soft-spoken , and unforgettably powerful .	2
the film might not have been engaging dramatically at all times , as it parcelled out its long tale reluctantly in bits and pieces , but it sets a haunting mood relating the lives of these laconic characters to the building of the country .there are a number of striking visual scenes ; such as , the train passing through the breathtaking mountain landscape , which indicates what a difficult chore it must have been to lay tracks in that location .the scottish actor peter mullen gave a wonderfully restrained performance , convincing as the man who did wrong and doesn't know how to make things right except by trying to when given a second chance .	2
the story allows us to see each of their points of view clearly as their character is fully developed ; it is so smartly and subtly done without patting itself on the back , that it becomes a pleasure to watch such an intelligent presentation on the problems of love and of one developing taste .the performers all do a marvelous job of getting this across and they make the film a joy to see .it's thankfully a film that has a life of its own and shuns any formulaic way of resolving this tale , which should only disappoint zombie viewers of familiar hollywood love stories .	2
stanley kubrick until his untimely death was working on a project that weighed for a long time on his mind -- the subject of artificial intelligence .what spielberg delivers is a film that leaves you thinking about what the end of human civilization means and how close to artificial intelligence can the world be as its reality , and about how love is something that can't be programmed without something being amiss about it .it's a spiritual odyssey about creation that david takes in the hardened nocturnal world of what remains of urban civilization , which is a reflection of a literary hell .	2
it's written and directed by the great japanese filmmaker , nagisa oshima ( in the realm of the senses/empire of passion/merry christmas , mr .taboo has a dreamlike quality to it that is spellbinding as it creates an eerie blue mood and makes the characters glow with a haunting feeling that this tale is taking place in the afterworld .kano is very appealing because of his boyish locks of hair and sensual and regal mannerisms , and his great ability as a warrior ; his stunning looks attracts everyone's attention .	2
kissed " is based on the original story by barbara gowdy " we so seldom look on love , " and directed with economy in her first feature by canadian lynne stopkewich .the film comes with voice-overs from molly , in her quiet , gentle voice , and the photography at times becomes glowing in a heavenly whiteness or darkly pressing in a sobering blue shade .the film's only fault is in how slight the story is and how it failed to go beyond the shocking taboo point of its " crossing over " theme and really explore that untested subject matter in more depth .	2
the film's other aim is to show the lost dreams and violence that fills america's wastelands and wounds those living there .the film is quirky , atmospheric , interesting in its character study , and is successful as a black comedy .the film has plenty of action scenes , culminating with a motorcycle chase ; a good twist in the murder mystery story ; and , what it does best is show how lonely people could be and how this is sometimes the driving force behind the false lives they lead .	2
blood simple is highlighted by an absolutely wonderous performance that is both sleazy and diabolical by m .made on a shoestring budget , the film sparkles because its characters are lively and quirky .i saw it on a recently digitally-remastered video version where the director cut off a few minutes of unnecessary dialogue .	2
as a misleading clue , one page of the diary is left on the floor .	2
it turns out that she didn't murder anyone , it was all the theater group's idea of testing out her skills as an actress in this real-life audition to see if she would get the part .it makes for a rousing climax , as karlson is good at doing the revenge thing in a crisp and rugged way .it's an absorbing film that holds your interest as it explores the life of people in the ring .	2
the film was superbly shot in b & w by john alton in a semidocumentary style .it's a solid film noir effort , which was also able to get in some comments on social consciousness between the ethnic montalban and the snobbish bias the elitist edmon ryan portrayed .	2
as is obviously intended , two can play that game is sure to hit big with the african american audience , but it should also be treasured as a great date movie for the moviegoing public at large .the film , written and directed by mark brown , makes a common hollywood mistake of confusing sexuality with true passion .seldom do filmmakers gamble their success on such an unusual style , but the conceit gives the movie a sense of independence , attitude , and a unique , experimental flavor .	2
an exciting film noir robbery escapade set in la , one that set the standard for such films .director richard fleischer shot the film in a taut manner , while the photographs of the dark la locale added grit to the film .	2
walter is discovered by leonard as a murderer , but since collectors are willing to pay big bucks for such detailed realistic work--he doesn't tell the cops .character actor dick miller gives an impressionable performance , as does his romantic interest barboura morris .it's a bloody black comedy that is gruesomely funny and because of its unsophisticated way of probing into the underground art world--it exudes a radiant charm , a true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras .	2
black angel is a film noir armed with the following : a brilliant script by roy chanslor that is taken from a cornell woolrich novel , an engaging performance turned in by dan duryea who is in a rare role as someone sympathetic , and it is directed flawlessly with craft-like skills by roy william neill .the low-budget film had a stunning simplicity to it that evoked all kinds of feelings for the players involved in this imaginative story and dramatic tragedy .the film also presented an excellent character study of the dan duryea character , making him into a complicated black angel figure .	2
authenticity " is what makes zubin jump with rosy delight as his sense of artistic merit is realized by his moves to keep the production as a collaboration that is an international effort .also interesting were the shots contrasting the opera setting in the ming dynasty with the routine life in modern beijing and its new hi-risers , and its citizens craving for consumer goods such as cell phones and tv's as they seem to be embarked on building a totalitarian style materialistic society .zubin and miller had a different agenda than either the communist regime or for that matter zhang , and if the gap could be bridged through music that would be of benefit to world peace .	2
a triumph of quirkiness over a hackneyed western story to make it a very appealing film that varies slightly from the genre .there was some controversy surrounding this film as it was probably not good for anyone's career to appear in it , as many in the production were either blacklisted or were subpoenaed to appear before the house of un-american activities committee .it was skillfully made , had style and the expressions of an auteur filmmaker to make it standout from other westerns .	2
he also struts across the stage as a super-star would , dons a multitude of wigs , lovingly shows off gams that are the equal of betty grable's , and captures our attention with his sad and meaningful story .it's one that calls out for tolerance in a spirited way , as it transcends pop culture and touches on the search the young have to find something in this world to believe in .the film was both amateurish and glossy in a professional sense , and whatever it did--worked ; even using many gimmicky filmmaking techniques - including the stunningly gorgeous animated pieces by award-winning artist emily hubley .	2
this impressive debut film is visually very powerful , it has plenty of images to relate to what's burning inside james .this audacious film seems like a nightmare , or a dream that james can't wake up from .the result is a lyrical work that has a numbing affect because of its sparseness and tight images ; it's a film of high quality .	2
both matriarchs give oscar quality performances , in a film that is based on the novel by elizabeth sanxay holding called " the blank wall " and directed by the team who did suture--david siegel & scott mcgehee .it didn't convince me in the older version , nor does it in the newer ; but swinton as the perfect mom is convincing , as we see the determination and pain in her face as it is drawn tight in gaunt looks out at the world that has turned hostile for her .it's a moving but restraint performance and gives the art-house thriller some depth .	2
les biches ( the does ) ( director : claude chabrol ; cast : jean-louis trintignant ( paul thomas ) , jacqueline sassard ( why ) , st ?que ) , dominique zardi ( riais ) , 1968-france ) this is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business .that chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters , each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them , plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common .	2
can you imagine that this innovative , creative film , a groundbreaker for its time , managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director , as the subject's sexual content was too much to take for so many of the self-righteous critics of that time !this is a film about scoptophilia ( voyeurism ) : the morbid urge to gaze , or as it is more commonly called , being a peeping tom .this fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by hitchcock or chabrol .	2
that ahmed goes on to the next village , despite warnings of not to go , is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed , if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant .the narrowness of life and the barren landscape , are excellent props for the director's vibrant themes , shot without professional actors and done in a low key , realistic style .his relentless pursuit is poetically evocative , depicting life in its raw elements .	2
by seeing who this man is , we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life , the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it , his easy and almost gentile manners , and his very definite american persona , as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises , and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual , who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others , so the closer we get to him , the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered .this scene could also be deemed as an attack on america's soul , exposing it to questions about truth and character , principles that are put under the microscope , as the story builds to its very tragic outcome .one of the scenes that i found most memorable , was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear , at first , was the muffled conversations of the patrons , as the camera meticulously panned the diner , until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation , which became clearer , as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film .	2
the most memorable scene in the film , is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll , when a red spot appears on it , looking like jam .spinning an eerie psychological thriller , whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in , are painted with a master's elegant brushstrokes .this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background , the magnificent limestone caves , and the casual manner village life went on , giving this film a very natural atmosphere .	2
ian is very intense , almost over the edge , but he makes sense to these victims , and he requires no payment if he loses the case , but will be getting 1/3 of the settlement if he wins .one of the best of the recent lawyer genre films now being made ( it is the best one i have seen ) , and the only reason it is not a masterpiece , in my opinion , is because it was too real , something metaphorical about it was lacking ; i went away from the film intellectually gratified , but did not feel the film opened up the emotional wounds of the locals whereas they would see anything more about the tragedy than the fact that their lives had been changed ; even if , some of the locals now question their motives to retain a lawyer , and that is now questioned in a way that it has never been questioned before .i have no problem with that aspect of the film , that was convincingly conveyed to me ; as was , the lawyer's motives , who comes across to us as not a good or an evil man , he is a man driven and ripped apart by guilt , even to the point of exhibiting bizarre behavior , as he searches to find a meaning for his life that he doesn't quite understand anymore , which is apparently more true than his belief that he is so committed to his work because he is trying to find justice for his clients ; so what we have , what remains for us to ponder , is the fact that nothing is as simple as the accident is ; everyone's life has been changed and nothing is the same anymore .	2
this " take me seriously " three and a half-hour film is surprisingly never dull , and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable participants in experimental living , that has its ups and downs as far as their compulsive libertine tendencies go .all the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish 1970s rebellion is seen here , along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the similar mind-set , allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it should be for them , if what they are into is to be taken seriously as some kind of revoluntionary statement .it is worth noting , that the director of this seminal work , jean eustache , killed himself at age 42 in 1981 , and that certainly some parts of this film were based on his real-life experiences .	2
melville wanted to make a french version of john huston's noir classic , the asphalt jungle ( 50 ) , as melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a gangster picture should look like , making it original while covering all the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs for 150 minutes .the intense action scenes amidst the changing weather from rain to snow , plus the wooded area and the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to paris , gives the film an air of resolute desperation , that is intriguing to watch , as each camera shot is done by the hands of a master , reaching far into his characters and their surroundings .it has done an outstanding job in uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation , that drive men so hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature .	2
the theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious , it is very difficult to feel much of anything for these middle-class drop-outs , as we first encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse , retardedly eating their food , under the direction of one of them ( susanne ) , who pretends to be their keeper , while one of them , stoffer , grabs on to a lady ( karen ) , sitting alone , and refuses to let go of her .they do another spassing in a rockwood furniture factory , which was more stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made about workers in a factory or about middle-class values , it was goofy in a way to watch them operate , as it seemed to be similar to the way that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to their older members who already went through the initiation process to join the group , but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a bunch of spoiled children .this very unusual personal film , that is very difficult to warm up to , that mocks what is conventionally thought of as right , by doing what is unconscionable and politically incorrect , becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend , as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel , as they seem to be left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments ; and possibly , their emotional experiences that they can value .	2
this film moved me a great deal , as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization .ray's choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers , especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe , is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn't forget our roots .his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera , poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought , allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director's creative life , questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in , as he leaves us with this last eloquent film , one that has his signature firmly on it .	2
the harshness and dreariness of the story is so pervasive , filled with so much pathos and heart wrenching evil , that it takes a great director such as rivette , to bring life and breath to the soul of the film , to keep out any superfluous material to this already startling story .rivette has made a memorable film , a grand and mesmorizing film , one that towers over other such benign hollywood films relating to this subject matter .her tragic plight is a powerful story , told with perfection of style and purpose , a story that is hard to put out of your mind .	2
as for me , i could have seen this film as many as twenty times already , starting when i was 12-years-old and first saw it on a tv program called " the million dollar movie , " and i still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it with each viewing .the gifted director james whale knew what to do with this story , as his serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is : there are certain things on earth man must not meddle in .kemp is scared out-of-his wits , and the scene is filled with pathos , melodrama , and ironical wit , as griffin dresses in his unwilling guest's robe and pajama's and usual bandage disguise , and explains to him that his invisibilty is not perfect , after eating his food it could be seen for an hour afterwards , until it is fully digested , that in the cold air you could see his breath , in the rain he would look like a bubble , that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man , because he hasn't quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes .	2
the camera work is stupendous , capturing in total the dreamlike quality of the film .we witness a wedding in the snow , a giant hand of creation being lifted out of the sea by a crane , and the innocent kids gazing out at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them .the mood is so harsh , even biblical in scope , that when it asks the question in its voice-over , " if i were to shout , who would hear me ? "	2
tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent story and exceptionally fine performances .in any case , it is better this way than the usual sentimental hollywood rags to riches treatment of such a story .this film is more in the spirit of reading someone like dickens , with strong oedipal emotions added to the bleakness of the story , as it is adapted from a novel by ferdinand bordewijk .	2
this is a come to your own conclusion movie , that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution , but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story .but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide , and badii's cogent argument , that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying , just falls on deaf ears .bagheri ( baghieri ) is a turk , who talks incessantly , giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch , with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on , and its close-ups on badii in his vehicle .	2
losing , because silence means you can't voice what is in your heart and mind , and by remaining silent it can be interpreted as a tacit acceptance of defeat and an unwillingness to call out for what is right and wrong .melville's film is stimulating and perplexing , yet it is simple in tone and in human spirit .it gave me chills to watch how natural it all seemed ; firstly , because the protaganists were so real and the situation was so menacing ; and , secondly , everything happens in such a matter of fact way , enhanced by being shot in the harsh and convincing tones of black-and-white , giving the film a certain disquiet with the sea in the background that is unsettling to behold .	2
, constantly hearing its pulsating city rhythms , experiencing its dark fears , and you are always aware of the noise and many distractions there are , especially when you need space to think .what makes this vampire type of film different than the others , is that it is very personal , more about the psychological state of a guy who doesn't seem to be a psychotic , but is very confused about the new direction his life is taking him .fessender has fully thought out the details of how a person can break down in front of us and not have any recourse in putting a stop to it , making the story as plausible and far-reaching as possible .	2
nigel hawthorne was simply brilliant in this role , conveying an urbane wit and a strong backbone for taking on the fight for a cause he believes in with all his heart .you might have to wait a long time before you find a film with both a family and a lawyer portrayed in such a genuine and likable mold .it was delightfully startling to watch the nuances every character performed , as they held their emotions in check by their keen intellect .	2
it is the kind of work that pre-dated the great jean-pierre melville's classic bob the gambler .and the director was just as interested in doing those scenes , as he was in filming the action ones .it has a hypnotic rhythm about it that takes you right into the gangster atmosphere it presents on screen ; there is not one wasted shot .	2
this is a visually appealing hong kong ghost story film , that is highly stylized , told from the perspective of a courtesan , anita mui ( fleur ) .the film is evocative ; its strength lying mostly in its poetical presentation , as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and intelligence .even its ironical ending , is handled with great dignity and care ; and , even if , you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural tale , the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had , such as the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone .	2
his menacing sneers are unforgetable , adding spice to a feature that makes grand use of every shot taken , and for its very limited budget of $75 , 000 , equals in style and eloquence the highest budgeted films of that era .kubrick has created a sinister noir film , employing dark angle shots and a hand held camera , which is used effectively in the street scenes where he probably didn't have official permission to be filming .it is one of my favorite noir films ; it had something about it that i enjoyed that goes beyond its taut story and authencity , it reminded me so much of how the 1950s were a time of alienation and failed dreams for youngsters who were trying to capitalize on the boom times after ww11 .	2
there was no background music to take your mind off where you were , and by going through in precise real-time movements the daily prison grind , the constant personal searches and searches of the food parcels the men received , with the guard slicing up the rice puddings looking for files and such , the viewer gets the feeling what prison life is like for the men .they have accepted claude as one of them , as there was no reason not to , and feel that he has done his part so far in helping them dig a tunnel and has even shared with them the food parcels he has received .what he has created in this thriller is a marvel in simplicity and understated relationships , showing how uncertain it could be to trust an outsider with your life .	2
the romantic maudlin gypsy music that opens the film , is followed by the oppressive factory sounds- a source of confinement and class differences .nevertheless , this is a powerful and well made film , and the performance of katalin berek , in a role where she defies social conventions but who must be someone that the audience can empathize with , is handled with a quiet dignity and aplomb .the entire ensemble cast is well suited to bring off this drama in a successful way , making one wonder , that even when the bureaucrats are seen as benevolent and people are finally sympathetic to a young girl's plight , life is still difficult .	2
life in this remote country village , called varkut , is oppressive , with nothing to do but work hard and eat a lot and watch bland tv programs .there is a coldness and distance about her , that speaks ill of hungarian society and its lack of warmth .its heartfelt dramatics and sparse dialogue , help make it a film of great quality and integrity .	2
in a place like manhattan where it is easy to get lost in its few million people , it is non-conformists' characters like speed that make things interesting and worthwhile .that central park was designed by the transcendentalist fredrick law olmstead , whose vision for the park was not to play baseball or jog or roller blade or a place in which to work up a sweat but to focus on nature in a peaceful meditation .i loved this ecclectic tour ; it is shot in a clear video which is blown-up to 35mm , and looks magnificent in b & w , giving the film the proper atmospheric expression for its tour ; the documentary works so well because speed's for real , as is his flowery monologue and his genuine nyc nasal accent .	2
; cast : jean-claude brialy ( paul ) , gerard blain ( charles ) , juliette mayniel ( florence ) , claude-cerval ( clovis ) , 1959-fr . )chabrol has carefully painted a picture , indicating that there is no help in sight for those who need it , whether from the pillars of society or from the rebels .it is chabrol's rather cynical , but fair look at how parisian society operates and how young people suffer from the pangs of youth , sometimes even in a deadly manner .	2
strange , bizarre , confusing , and psychedelic , all are apt descriptions for this easy to follow story but most difficult film to keep track of .that is mainly due to the elliptical editing , fast cuts , forward and backward flashbacks , and a montage of images with all kinds of implications behind them .the freshness and energy and montages of the film are unique , as it was able to mix the world of art with violence , something that seems to be a natural fit , as shown in these kaleidoscope images .	2
the film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences , though not pleasing all the critics .through all kinds of sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly received film , pasolini attempted to make his point about current italian society being like fascism .pasolini , the decadent anti-fascist , pro-communist , homosexual artist is a key figure in trying to come to grips with modern italy and its many passions , this documentary provides some useful fodder about him , whether you are a novice to him or have followed his career fully .	2
what is noteworthy about the telling of the story , is how earnest and real their situation is , and how magnificently graceful the actors are , slowly revealing the sore points and tender sides of their troubled souls .but it did try to get too clever with the plot allowing every angle of the character's problems to fit too nicely together-- there was too much of a parallel symbolism of the castaways relating to their three lives that was too neat for its own good .the film didn't always work , as melodramatics seemed to take away from the tremendous drive the story had on its own merits as a straight romantic tale .	2
this emotionally moving film will look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working class girls , doing it in a way only the french can do it justice .isa is someone we think we know but really don't , as she is prone to be friendly and willing to make relationships , opening her dark saucer eyes wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go along with her warm personality and trim look of close-cropped black hair ; but , we are , also , distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her right eyebrow , which is never explained .it is a film that not only depicted the shattering of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class , but it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the girls , looking at it in a poetic way .	2
this unique film , in the style of the maysles brother's the salesmen , packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and improvisational work .the theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology , in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen .these very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on camera , as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat , in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre .	2
this film was shot with a small video camera ( a sony pc7 ) that fits in the palm of your hand , then it is transferred to the prescribed dogma 35-millimeter format .the result of the film was exhilerating , dogma or not , it is a work that is scathing , penetrating layers of deceit and festering wounds that cannot be healed .vinterberg declares how the impact of helge's revelation affected everyone in the immediate family , and how that acted as a cleansing for the tribe , something that was essential for their psyches .	2
the visionary dream is evocative of the music he created for the 1st movement of the third sympathy , as it is heard and interpreted by russell in a way that is highly complimentary to a composer whom he obviously admires , flawed personality , not withstanding .always insecure and troubled , never happy , always irritable and petulant , a most unpleasant person , and a sexist ; but , a musical genius , is the impression of mahler that russell convincingly leaves us with .which result for russell , a director who has proven himself to be a music lover , who knows how to be flamboyant and controversial , into making a film that was very impressive .	2
that both men achieved excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition through the eyes of normal lifestyles is , indeed , a curious oddity .and that is demy's point , that coincidences , luck , and good timing seem to matter even more than love .american audiences rarely get a chance to see his great body of films , and that is surely their loss .	2
the conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over saving a life- there is no better feeling , he tells us in a voiceover , his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees all around him everyday .the nicolas cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a bewitching manner , as in his crazed ems role , he catches the futility and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with patricia arquette .the ambulance drivers more or less drove home the philosophical points of the film , as they acted out the insanity of the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being beaten down or hyper , with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes perversive attitude toward the job .	2
, a film with lots of sight-gags , made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family , mr .there is a comic sandal fight among the boys , which brings out the film's visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters .and like many parents in america , he only wishes his children have a better life than he does , which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light .	2
he leaves for work at the sound of the eerie throbbing of the jungle drums , which is only announcing that the sugar syrup is ready to be poured .the obscure motives of the mother and the nurse , and to who was at fault in paul's marriage , and what role wesley plays in all this , is never cleared up completely by the film but that only makes the story more intriguing .the power of the script , is in the telling of a tale about local superstition built around the moral dilemma of what is the christian concept of right and wrong , and by creating an unforgettable and haunting atmosphere that blows away the less than sterling acting by the male leads and the unlikeliehood of the story being totally believable .	2
special weightless effects were obtained by camera trickery to show the little girl flying up to the ceiling and the poet moving painfully along the corridor wall .once cocteau discovered that he could turn shooting disasters into excellent footage , he was off on a career of making films that carried his trait of creating trick shots : the miraculous mirror and mercury scene in orphee , the live arms holding the candelabra from the walls of la belle et la bete , and the accelerated time sequences of flowers opening in le testament d'orphee are only a few examples of the trick shots he used in his later films .the life-line of the movie is its imagery , which can be interpreted many different ways , emphasizing cocteau's view that art disclaimed the world of ordinary appearances and projected vision to be a symbolic representation that must be continually changing , because if it doesn't it will be dead like classicism is and it will cease to exist .	2
first-time film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on , cooked by charles kaufman's original screenplay , that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate , such as a psychological , personal and sexual identity study , allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being .but even as it was petering out , it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity , to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing , and leave off with an ending that is unnerving .what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well , is that the actors get the joke and run with it , even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize .	2
this seemingly simple murder plot , of a crazed medieval-type of svengali , who orders his somnambulist to do his killings , is much more complex than that , and it is one of the reasons that this film has meant so much to so many different people at different time periods .by its odd style , accented mannerisms , all the actors wearing grotesque makeup , and exhibiting a stagy acting method , it becomes a very unsettling film .caligari , however limited in scope , is still a powerhouse of a horror film , a significant breakthrough in style and in expression : a poetical vision .	2
la promesse has the harsh reality to it that a documentary might have , and considering that the sibling film directors are acclaimed documentary directors for over two decades , it is easy to see that even though this story is fictionalized it , neverthess , is filmed in the manner of the very real experiences that the filmmakers have noted going on in modern europe .there is room for us to see in him what makes him act the way he does , that he is not that far removed from the consciousness' of the ordinary man in the street , except for his utter lack of decorum and any sort of social conscience .it casts a dark shadow over a civilized country's technological prowess in the world , and questions its humanity and moral perspectives .	2
the often filmed story of joan of arc , but a story that is seldom successfully filmed , is attempted again by jacques rivette ( up/down/fragile ( 95 ) /la belle noiseuse ( 91 ) /la religieuse ( 65 ) /celine et julie vont en bateau ( 74 ) ) , and the results for this epic study of joan are more than pleasing but less than scintillating .in this film , it is the king's coldness and the church's intrigue that strikes us , while joan and the soldiers she fights with , are given a warm treatment , as if they were the heroes in a hollywood war movie .but this film seems to be the most accurate version of all the joan films , thus far , as rivette followed the trial transcripts and whatever history of her battles were recorded by eyewitnesses , but it failed to move me in an intimate way as much as the dreyer version did , which made more of a personal statement and an artistic response to those in power who try to stifle the voice of an individual's expression , while rivette uses the visual epic scope of history to make his point , that the call for freedom is not necessarily separate from politics .	2
the combination of lyrical , odd scenes of naturalism and the melodrama of a crime-fiction story , as the film is full of disappearances and disguises , sudden deaths and uncanny resurrections , hidden trapdoors and secret tunnels , bus chases and rooftop escapes- which gave the film its power , its sense of dread ( perfectly matching the public's mood at the time of world war1 ) .and it was that , coupled with their almost anarchistic view of society ( the vampires steal only from the rich ) , and their often contemptuous disregard of logic ( the result of tight shooting schedules ) , that made the films so popular .les vampires is one of france's great classic contributions to the world of cinema ; and fortunately , this once lost film has now been restored and is available on video .	2
what results is an hallucinatory fable : that is funny , scary , idiosyncratic , original , lesbian-centered , derivative of cartoons and musicals , and truly indescribable .it is a film that should be seen more than once , since it requires proper mood and spirit to enter its delightful summertime montmartre locale and the visions of its meditations , and it takes some getting used to , since this is a different type of cinema from the usual american fare .this is a special movie that some might detest or feel put upon on first viewing it , but is for others an exhilarating work , an outstanding example of a non-commercial film , allowed to take on the personalities of the stars without worry about it being a formula story or needing a glib ending .	2
'he is one of the world's greatest actors ( he was tevye in fiddler on the roof ) but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be .this comedy/romance that turns dramatic , should give you a good idea of how great an actor he is .though he is not a religious man , he respects the traditions , as the film makes many biblical allusions in telling its story .	2
those two great legends in the horror field went on from here to make a total of seven films together , but none as co-stars with equal parts , or in a feature that was as good as this one was .in most of their films together , lugosi , who was the poorer actor of the two because of his limited english , was always cast in the lesser role .the crowley characterization was by boris karloff , who played the role of hjalmar poelzig .	2
the explosions take place in slow-motion and pink floyd's " careful with that axe , eugene " plays as the products of commercialization go floating by .she promptly takes off , as antonioni is sending a message that if you think you can escape from the world and your responsibilities by retreating from it , you are mistaken , you only make matters worst .the film originally garnered bad reviews in general and ended up being a commercial failure , subjecting the director to some unfairly harsh criticism .	2
as film noir , this hard-boiled story is much superior to the more popular and more critically acclaimed " bonnie and clyde , " which covered the same territory story-wise : amour fou- the running away together by lovers .this fast-action film , with its typically notorious femme fatale depicted , is subversive to the nth degree .whatever weakness the story had as it waivered between art and entertainment , and even if it was acted by not the most accomplished of actors , yet there was a raw innocence about it creating a special kind of appeal to those who could feel its lively pulse beating to their resentment of the establishment .	2
it also could be thought of as a political allegory , a critical reaction to the witchhunt of mccarthyism taking place at the time , of the senator's self-righteous attacks on those he didn't like and for going after others for reasons of guilt by association .the film opens in stunningly beautiful trucolor , as johnny guitar is crossing the mountainous terrain and the mesas , and the pastel colors of that scenery comes across as particularly striking .no western has ever had female leads with twisted personalities such as in this one and a psychopathic drifter as its sort of reluctant hero .	2
a precious and unnerving thriller , one that never fails to offer some kind of hitchcockian surprise , as the film is unpredictable throughout .this somber thriller is a beauty , projecting a maddening character study , and infiltrating a secretive and cold world , where the protagonist , a private wire-tapper , has lost his sense of direction , knowing that one's privacy can so easily be exposed by expert technicians like himself and be used for any purpose .the acting was magnificent on all parts , the story was grippingly told , and its denouement , is the equal of the best thrillers ever made .	2
" laura " is an elegant but campy b&w " who-dun-what , " noted for its witty dialogue and exquisite romantic atmosphere among the upper-class society types being confronted by a detective from the proletarian-class .it is a good thing otto won his argument , because his choices all did great jobs , and webb , lashell , and preminger all received oscar nominations , with only the cinematographer winning .the film brought out the following observable things about the suspects : ann seems more masculine than feminine , shelby appears to have stereotypical " gay " tendencies , while waldo is a flaming bitch ; as they all exhibit , in the very least , a certain amount of sexual ambiguity .	2
but the fireworks between the lovers is only beginning , as both feel betrayed and unsure of what to do .the magic in the film is in the chemical reaction between garfield and lana , their performances are sizzling .the reason the film is so provocative , is that it hits below the belt , where the lovers were most vulnerable .	2
his films are noted for not being linear narratives and for examining people who are in a state of moral decay .this all indications point to these arguments taking place over a long period of time .all these characters are emotionally distraught , suffering from jangled nerves and loneliness .	2
the drunken mccabe succeeds by luck : by being at the right spot , at the right time , and not by any skills he might possess .altman's film is strikingly lyrical and perfect in mood ; it is a dreamlike film that is hauntingly memorable , that is magical in scope and sadly touches mccabe's yearnings to find love and a place to put down roots .miller's wishful dreams are seen as either foolish romantic notions or drug induced inspirations , ones that never had a chance of coming true .	2
the power in the film is from the sheer force of the clash of ideas and the expressions coming forth from the nonprofessional actors .they drew most of their sense of history from the 1940s by watching newsreels , but in the film they only used voice-overs from professionals who donated their services and used montages and close-ups to get the 1944 look they wanted .you can say whatever you want about their methods , but when you look at the results you feel the intensity and madness of the drama , it has a curious starkness about it that is very compelling .	2
there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time .but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic .their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind .	2
charlton heston as will penny , gives , arguably , his best performance ever , in this magnificent western on an aging cowboy , a loner , an illiterate , faced with the prospects of a dim future .written and directed by tom gries , who achieved critical but not commercial success with this demanding psychological character study on the hardships of a cowboy's lonely life , one of the most underrated westerns ever made .the script captures the nuances and local flavor of the cowboy on the trail in an authentic and moving manner .	2
tietou tries to make sense out of what happens to his ordinary family , but he just can't seem to fully comprehend why so much misfortune occurred . "it clearly showed the horrors of the human drama inflicted on its subjects , the tremendous portrayal of motherhood by lu liping , and the oppression emanating from the chinese dictatorship .this lyrical film offers an eye-opening experience about recent events there , and probably the only people it can't penetrate , are the maoist international movement , a group that is in self-denial about how tyrannical china is .	2
it also has an opulent cinematography by dick pope , the eye-pleasing stagework of gary yershon , the just right costumes by lindy hemming and the impeccable performances by all concerned , with special kudos to jim broadbent as the constantly sulking and cranky librettist william schwenk gilbert .the beauty of the film , making it so much more than the typical musical , is that the director caught the environment of victorian society , allowing it to add a socio-historical perspective to the backstage dramatics of the theater people and to the travails of the g & s partnership .this historical perspective was depicted , by flashing the newspaper headline of the death of general gordon and his men in the khartoum massacre on the screen and then the film zeroes in on some actors stuffing themselves on oysters , basking in the bourgeois society the empire has made possible for them and so many others in england .	2
this is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s .he begins by saying : " i would like to say a few words about weddings .carroll ) , proves to be an unpleasant problem to deal with , as stanley wryly says , " an experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in fifteen minutes . "	2
he is a tiny , mousy , and loquacious man , someone who compulsively can't stop talking about what he does for a living , which lends a dismal sense of perverse comedy for half the film until his unchecked demeanor began to grate on me and he became overbearing .earl morris makes documentaries about as good as anyone ever has , tackling subjects that others would shy away from ( this being his seventh feature- some others are-gates of heaven/fast , cheap & out of control/the thin blue line ) .his works are not mere biographies or hollywood driven achievement celluloids , but poetics of the cinema that sing to our inner sense of being , that make us think about the life of the person on film in a way that we most likely wouldn't have thought about them if we had not seen what morris saw and presented us with .	2
it is a movie that is mostly invigorated by forest whitaker's stunning performance of a man who is an icon , who lives by myth alone , whose most memorable statement , is that " the end is important in all things . "ne , the splendid expressive performance by forest whitaker , the underlying humor , and the freshness of jarmusch's approach to filmmaking , proving that he is someone willing to take chances .this film is similar in mood to his other ambitious work , which was a masterpiece , dead man , and it is one that makes so many fine points to justify its wide range of themes .	2
it is visually the best of such films made , a classic study in heroism and in military planning , that stays with the men in battle as they fight for survival and doesn't go off into the politics of why they are there .the film offers no explanation about the racial nature of the conflict , as it is played mostly as a story of a courage on both sides .it was also an interesting bit of casting by the co-producers endfield and baker , of having the cockney caine play a stuffy upper class englishman .	2
this riveting noir thriller was made on the heels of the kefauver crime hearings in the u .it has the auteur signature of lang written all over it , with outstanding performances from a cast that puts their stamp of reality on the film .its nihilistic message about humanity is scarring , glenn ford's pyrrhic victory in the end and his restoration to his old job , seems to have a cynical feel to it , meaning that violence and corruption go together in city politics like ham and eggs .	2
mckellar goes for the smaller private moments rather than a grand philosophical argument about the meaning of life or a catastrophic special effect ending .the focus of the film isn't on any sort of biblical apocalypse , nor is it on the outside revellers and looters , or on those who gather in the city square to make it a new year's eve celebration , but it is on those who think out what they want to do and plan to spend a thoughtful evening preparing for the end .the sardonic humor and clever performances by sandra oh , don mckellar and callum keith rennie , leave a lasting impression .	2
this indie film is filled with many gratifying small touches , as it takes its time developing and forces one to tune into the way victor sees things .there is something precious about this film , whether in shelley winters warm performance as a giving but possessive mother , or from pruitt taylor vince's priceless performance of someone who hardly speaks and is a doting son , longing for love and friendship , but who still hasn't matured , or from liv tyler's refreshing role as the one who breeds life into the dead feelings of both mother and son , giving them some hope for the future .the musical score arranged by thurston moore helped set the quiet mood needed for the story to gently unfold .	2
the dardenne brothers have made an urgent film about today's job market that hits home on its universal pathos and how those on the bottom are taken advantage of by unfair employment practices .it's a theme that forces you to look at the young girl in an introspective way and at her poverty as something that is real and not something that can be dismissed by other distractions in the story .what makes this film so uncompromising and ironical , is that we are not asked to like or even accept rosetta , we are only allowed to understand that she does what she has to in order to exist .	2
a marvelously compelling documentary , even if it seems rigged when it isn't , as everything fits so smoothly together due to the efficiency of the filmmakers .it is the same storefront gym that produced riddick bowe and where mike tyson worked out , so success has already touched some who climbed out of this slum .life is tough in bed-stuy and no matter what some supposedly well-meaning liberals say about the violent nature of the sport , for some , it is a way out of their predicament .	2
it is a wonderfully banal film about a flying saucer landing on the north pole and a superior alien , who looks like frankenstein , being thawed out .the cast is perfect , their non-chalant attitude gives the film its raucous mood and allows the warlike atmosphere between beast and man to be a battle of both wits and brawn .the film closes with the excited scottie breaking the story to the world , screaming into the microphone : " i bring a warning--to every one of you listening to the sound of my voice .	2
dariush mehrjui is one of iran's finest modern filmmakers , his speciality is making films about relationships among the upper-middle-class illuminati , and especially love stories about women .this drama is a very powerful , poignant and mesmerizing love story , about the pressures of dealing with moslem traditions and of a woman's own sense of being .reza is never forceful enough in his statements telling her that it doesn't matter that she can't have children , as leila has nagging doubts about whether he really means it or is just saying it .	2
the film is blemished only by kurosawa's backtracking at the conclusion , coming up with an unconvincing and hokey humanistic ending to counter his more potent argument that everyone lies for selfish reasons .this was a unique filming device used by kurosawa , of zooming in on the character when telling his or her version , as each had a different rhythm that the camera underscored by revealing the particular mood of the storyteller .the common man is not surprised that mankind is selfish , as he takes a cynical view of humanity , anyway , listening to the story as if it's just a typical murder one .	2
spielberg's overall work pales in authencity besides it , even the landing on the beach scene , which wilde depicted in just as gory a way , holds its own with " saving private ryan . "it's a film whose voiceovers of how the men think hit deeply on the emotions of its subjects , also its use of flashbacks are superbly utilized , and its brutal coverage of the war itself has the force to show what combat must have felt like .when cornel wilde says , " that the trouble with killing , is that after awhile we forget why we are doing it , " we see how the film has the resourcefulness to deal with both its pacifist message and with the certain primitive rawness it portrays , that gives it that uncertain edge all influential picturesneed .	2
the song and dance numbers are playful , the story is meaningful , the performances are marvelously refreshing , and the plush settings are very colorful .the film's musical score is an easy one to remember by michel legrand , and its story is told almost exclusively by song , with lyrics by demy .the spirited choreography caught my fancy , even though it probably was not as perfect as jerome robbins would do , but it was a good enough imitation that was attempted by norman maen .	2
the dialogue is almost completely muted , as there are long stretches of golden silences and no translators for the deaf are used or needed to make things understood .they go to a spot where a regular crowd of surfers hang-out , and while shigeru is learning , the others laugh at his inexperience and lack of proper equipment , he doesn't even possess a wetsuit .this is a cinema fans true delight , a purely visual film without the need for high-tech artifices .	2
/singles/jerry the film is not raucous rock , but offers a sweet view of the music world , pointing out why its popularity is high among adolescents , while also exploring its business side .the casting was perfecto , not that the acting was necessarily arresting , but it was that everyone seemed natural for their roles and gave expression and a sense of truth to what was happening .that will be the mantra of the film and also its hardest attack on the industry , but it is carried out to perfection by this great cast and directed with a sure-hand for drawing out the comedy and whatever goodness there is in the artists and the groupies who follow them .	2
there is a quiet and easy pace that allows the stately film to be properly absorbed as a meditational exercise comparing the similarities of the spiritual , erotic and aesthetic world , and could be viewed by many as an end of an era work that is both enthralling and bound to rub some the wrong way for its politically incorrect moments .there is an intensity about the way the master's camera captures the stories that give his silence and his sometimes unsatisfyingly sophomoric dialogue an opening for ideas to be filtered through , making the sheer beauty of the mise en scene something not less than breathtaking .there is also a light comic scene , which seems to be thrown in as a joke at the director's expense , as the late marcello mastroianni is an artist on a country hillside copying a cezanne masterpiece and jeanne moreau is laughingly mocking him for not trying to do his own thing .	2
because of their terrific acting skills and peckinpah's stylish direction , this film turned out to be a classic , one of the better westerns made .this is one of peckinpah's more appealing films , it is visually stunning , fully capturing the gorgeous mountain landscapes and comparing it with the more gaudy view in the modernized town .it is also peckinpah's warmest portrait he paints of a woman's sufferings in any of his films , as one can only feel pity for the anguish the sexually repressed hartley has by living in such a backward frontier settlement .	2
roman polanski sets up a tense atmosphere for this macabre tale , where every black-and-white shot is subjectively motivated by the deranged character played with quiet brilliance by catherine deneuve , until the final shot becomes one of objective reality .the only thing to be said in favor of these ghastly murders are that these men were not nice and were extremely pushy , wanting to use her and not caring that she didn't even show the slightest interest in them .this is the first of roman polansky's english language film's and his second feature ( the first was " knife in the water " -1962 ) , and this one might be his best work .	2
the actors speak in muted tones , while in the background , the pulsating soundtrack of bands such as red 7 , shriekback , and iron butterfly , set the chilling mood .dante spinotti's photography is beautifully effective in making the urban and country landscapes fit so well into the tenseness of the storytelling , while the widescreen is the perfect way to see this original thriller .the stylish photography in this final scene , features mirrors , paintings , images , reflections , lunar landscapes , all pointing to the killer's urge to kill because he needs to be wanted and desired .	2
the arrangement blossoms as jerry enjoys taking care of them and acting fatherly to the little girl .penn has directed a superb film , that is interestingly photographed and brings out fine performances from this sterling cast .many cast members gave cameo performances that fit the grey mood of this very emotionally felt film .	2
it was also one of the most offbeat psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio , especially one such as mgm .the unknown " is a tightly made film , with a sinister plot and a startling and intense performance by chaney .the film presents an excellent study of character , though its theme is morbid and boiling with hatred it is still appealing because of its edginess .	2
a top-notch film noir about the loneliness and despair in tinseltown , which is more a weighty drama story than a murder mystery .it's the kind of temperament that could swing across the pendulum from a loving warmth to an insane rage .dix is not a very pleasant noir character ; he's someone trapped in his dark emotions , left in a lonely place where he can't work out his problems and can only be viewed as someone who is too alienated to make positive relationships .	2
it's a film noir that is influenced by freudian psychology , and was shot in 18 days by otto preminger .the result was that this was arguably her best film performance and otto , a known bully to actors , came up with an intelligent and exciting thriller .the film scores big because of the great nuanced performances from the stars robert mitchum and simmons , the sharp black and white photography contrasting the wealthy estate to mitchum's humble stature and rosy dreams , that the tale of obsessive love was credibly presented , and the typical noir tale of the protagonists getting hooked on sex and money gave the film the dark energy it thrived on .	2
this is an unsentimental and marvelously acted family drama , set in a backwater dumpy australian seacoast town .the script by laura jones is intelligent and pertinent , the woman director gillian armstrong ( my brilliant career ) has made a nearly flawless film , and the three lead actresses draw out their complicated characters in ways that touch the heart with the mark of unbridled reality .there are no easy answers given here , what the film does best is concentrate on how this accidental meeting has a devastating effect on all three lives and it does it in a fresh way .	2
a top-rate film noir from the master , alfred hitchcock , that is more or less a twisted tale about love .it's also more erotic than the usual hitchcock ones , as long kissing scenes are duly noted .in fact , one scene was supposedly " the longest kiss onscreen in the history of films , '' taking three minutes in all .	2
a brilliant and moving indie drama filmed on a shoestring budget of $400 , 000 , money allocated from the actors guild .maze mentioned that if he had to do it again , he would use guerrilla techniques allowing him to have a less glossy look but he would now have the ability to edit daily and reshoot scenes .the film looked great because of its photography , its script was well thought out and intelligently done , and even though the actors were not household names they were all superb .	2
d one and actually makes an attempt to flesh out the character of a teen who is searching for something that is not trivial , as she lashes back at being stuck in the urban sprawl scene of la that is inhabitated by so many shallow and phony people .through his unapologetic loneliness she sees her own , and even though this film is not geared for a predictable or a happy ending , it's this relationship with all its incongruities that is so fascinating , touching and tender to behold .i honestly can't remember how long its been since i have seen a teenage film as memorable as this one ( rushmore comes the closest ) .	2
a truly magificent and authentic film set in the sparsely populated mountainous region of dolpo in northwest nepal .the film becomes in its second half an amazing visual spectacle and a challenge to the filmmaker to record the earnest story in the most difficult of locations , as it follows the two parties through the barren highland valleys and unsafe mountain passes .i enjoyed it immensely and believe this rare film will be remembered for the simplicity of its very human story and the deep respect it has for a way of life that is endangered .	2
the story is multi-layered as it uses as its theme the crimes against citizens during the anti-communist campaign waged during the 1950s , giving it a complexity that requires the viewer to have a resolve to stick with this gloomy tale that is shot with a static camera and takes place in three different time periods ( past , present , and in the imagination ) .as the red army fought for control of china , chiang kai-shek -- supported by the americans -- rooted out all communists by force .annie shizuka inoh in the role of these women from different generations , gives an inspiring performance that evokes a genuine sympathy .	2
how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life ; that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself ? "the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgin's body are , indeed , startling .the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature , but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn , they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend .	2
melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner .his argument for a god couldn't be put forth with more verve and intelligence , even though it didn't convince me , as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion , nevertheless , this film moved me to further expand what i think .it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church , something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema .	2
what is truly amazing about this masterly done film , is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year , that is marked off by repeated radio reminders .the brilliance of the film , is that the story that unfolds is about the little girl's adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does , and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story ; it is something that is universally understood , that we forget that we are talking about iran , the country that we demonized , our arch enemy ; and , if the film can be criticized , it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not .the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity , and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved ; and , how childhood is explored , pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity , are unmatched in most hollywood films .	2
all that is superfluous to bob the gambler ; in this film , he is more interested in taking care of his trenchcoat and fedora and giving hand-outs to those he likes , than he is in doing anything else but looking good .by the film's end we are convinced that we know a lot about bob , and come to the conclusion that he's a pretty good guy , thinking to ourselves , even though he is linked to gambling and crime , nevertheless , he does possess a wonderful character about him , something that is worthy of our praise .a great film , that is shot with perfection , capturing the nuances and finesse a master film-maker brings to his work , while shooting a low-budget b/w film , that tells a simple story , but is done with such effervescence , as to make us feel so much the better that we at least met this perfectly flawed character , even if it is only on film , since , for most of us , it is more than likely we will not have the chance to meet the likes of a true character like him in person .	2
la belle noiseuse , which we are told , is the title of the masterpiece , is about a 17th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out , who is referred to as being someone who is a " ball-buster . "what makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work , are scenes such as these , where one's sense of time is lost , and the length of the picture , ( it is 240 minutes ) does not seem wasted even for a minute , as we watch and become part of the creation , starting from scratch , and actually are hearing the artist's scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants , even when she complains that he is hurting her .piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing , while emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent , offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses .	2
at one point of the film , his face turns to glee as he is in his newspaper's press room and he exclaims that he just loves the smell of the ink press , there is nothing better in the world than that smell .there is a certain feeling to this b/w illustriously cinematographed film , that reflects the belief ray has , that life is a continual rhythm of birth and death , one is complete because of the other .what this is a film that is visually poetic , stunning in its apperceptive recognitions of life in the raw , without any wasted movement exerted , with expressive gestures counting for unsaid dialogue and untold physical encounters replaced by a nuance , such as , by a romantic notion , as charu has on a swing , just by a toss of her head upwards and she is seen in a swoon , and a deliberate word from her will slowly be turning into a potion that is magically brewing , as it is taking charge of all her pent-up emotions , as we imagine that we actually can see what is taking place inside the heads of the would-be lovers , even if nothing explicit materializes .	2
he is of such a good nature , that he can't stand to argue with anyone or ask for something , even if it is rightfully his , putting all his fate in god .satyajit ray's old-fashioned and slow developing film , graced with the sublime sitar ragas of ravi shankar , is unpretentious and starkly beautiful in its depiction of the human condition just as it is , giving relevance to the lives of these ordinary people , without the need to be arty about it , as the characters find in their hearts how best to transcend the situation they are in .this film should be a magical lesson in film-making for those modern filmmakers who think they must inject heavy doses of symbolism to get their point across .	2
but with that being said , there is no denying that it is still powerful viewing because of its magically developed poetical gestures to the subject of love and the refreshingly lyrical way it looks out at its surrounding seascape towns and at the human condition .because their emotions and passions are so dominating , the quality of the film engulfs everyone aboard the barge in an unreal state .the film version to see , which is now on video , is the restored 1990 one , that pierre philippe and jean-louis bompoint recovered missing footage for .	2
the film's opening immediately engages us in its sexuality : the tall , curvaceous lady peeling off her black dress with her back to us , is nicole kidman , and the next shot fades to darkness , it is as if the curtain was pulled down on a sex show and we are told that now that we have seen her lovely ass , the rest is up to our imagination .that cruise is nearly perfect for the part ( the only slight negative thing about his performance was that his constant cell phone action reminded me too much of the jerry maguire character ) , as he displays a wide range of emotions and ability , to be a turd and then come back and be human again , is the kind of acting he hasn't been required to do so far in his career , but with the wonderful relationship he developed with stanley , he is able to understand who he is and be able to be convincing as a young doctor for the rich and as a dye-in-the-wool materialist , committed to being a doctor and intelligent enough to see changes in his life as necessities .what made the streets particularly foreboding was the skillful manipulation of lights to reflect either a dream or reality world he was in , with the penetrating brightness of the neon emanating from the clubs and storefronts making them look like sites from hell .	2
the country itself was a bit paranoid during this tense period of the cold war .as technology used in the wrong way was no laughing matter , a nuclear war was a strong possibility .the nature of the film is irreverence for those who are involved in building up this nuclear conflict .	2
it most closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great french directors jean-pierre melville and jacques becker , as a classic noir tale depicting man's foibles of greed and betrayal .it fits in with kubrick's notion of life : that it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the game does .as one of kubrick's early features , it remains one of his greatest films , even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour into his later high-budget , more complex movies .	2
that he hates indians so much , yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways , more so than he does with white society , makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them .make no mistake about it , this is not an ordinary or very good western , this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema , one that many of the early 1950s film critics couldn't see .over-the-years , the status of this film has grown immeasurably , to the point that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene , along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness .	2
the tedious pace of the film has a hypnotic affect , contrasting the primitive beastiality of our ancestors with the polite deceptions of our future relatives .while richard strauss' " thus spake zarathustra " , provided energy and vitality to the space flight and became the film's very popular signature theme .the aliens who created this environment are not shown , as the film ends very mysteriously , which has been a source of lots of commentary , and has inspired meanings-- from it's all rubbish-- to-- something divine has happened .	2
even with a minimal amount of conversations taking place , the characters were seen dancing and horsing around , as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a natural manner .streep's performance is more subtle , as her facial expressions give way to the great psychological strain she is under , not sure of what is happening to her , but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life .cazale's performance as a weasel , staying out of the war , hiding behind a phony macho persona , is a fitting one , in contrast to the guys who enlisted .	2
the genius of dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it was .the scene was so intense , that when it was being shot , all the stagehands brought her flowers on that occasion , and dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful it was .this is one of the most memorable films ever made , one that is hard to forget , as it ends on the bleakest of notes , with joan burned at the stake in front of a group of grieving spectators .	2
jim jarmusch ( stranger than paradise/permanent vacation/ down by law/ mystery train/night on earth ) has directed and written a poetically unique and disturbing western , one that is an american masterpiece , and is clearly one of the best films of the '90s .this film is viewed on the side of the outsider , the loner , and the visionary , who have the wherewithal to see through all the violence that america is built around in its pursuit of happiness and economic comfort .ller slowly unfolding , that catches hold of the deathlike odyssey sequences and the superb imagery of the landscape ) , but also relates a strong history lesson and a colorful mystical tour of the death experience that adds an especially vibrant visionary sense to this stunning and problematical film .	2
kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it .it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval .but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war .	2
its dark and moody cinematography is brilliantly shot by john seitz , setting up the hypnotic rhythmical flow of the story , as narrated by macmurray's noir-like voiceover .wilder told an interviewer that neff's death was among " two of the best scenes i've ever shot in my whole life " ( the other being the sunset boulevard opening ) .what this ending left was a question mark , as i wondered why neff returns to the office to confess to keyes , if what he really wanted to do was to escape .	2
you can chalk " m " up as a lasting masterpiece , created with a passion for detail and a successful transitional film from the silents to the talkies , taking into its mise en scene the best of both those worlds .it is evident that lang saw here the festering wounds nazism would later on fully exploit to its own advantages , in a society that was already decadent and had lost its sense of responsibility .the film is expeditious in its stark treatment of the innocuous lorre , who does not stand out from the crowd and is physically a small and fragile man .	2
writer/director john sayles weaves an intriguing story that is both a mystery and a study about the relationship between the generations and the races .the subtle message being that the past must be remembered but it is more important that the future must not be blurred by what already happened and can't be changed .there are no predictable and formulaic messages , this is one of the great films of the 1990s , one that is done with wit and tact .	2
it reminds me so much of jean-pierre melville's great existentialist character studies he presented in his noir films , such as in le samurai ( 67 ) , where the point of the film remains less on the story and more on how the protagonist is suave and calculatingly dispassionate .this is a perfectly nuanced film , with the atmospheric noir cinematography by lucien ballard , plus a brilliantly appropriate one-man guitar musical arrangement heard in the background .interestingly enough , the director and screenwriter never went on to something even close to the quality this b film achieved , while this role deservedly catapulted vince edwards career into stardom .	2
it was magnificently photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades as filmed by the great cinematographer russell metty , which abetted the imaginative tale , whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy , obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by orson .it is arguably the greatest opening shot in film history because of its visual impact in setting up the feature's characters and the tenseness of the story that was to follow .in the 1990s the film was finally pieced together from the memo orson sent the studio and the hack director's scenes were cut , and it picked up an additional three minutes .	2
it's a film so visually stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations , and most of all , in its lyrical sensuality , that it runs poetically adrift with its listless hypnotic pace , its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to see what is not being said , and by its strange brooding mood it sets , as it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate , alienation and envy through the eyes of the narrow-minded french foreign legionnaire who found freedom in his remorse .the minimally told story is made all the more powerful by many vivid shots , such as the one of the emerald water contrasted with the barren desert , or of the distant mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us of things we cannot know , or of the unobtrusive native women in their colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco , who strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones .what adds to the film , is the robust musical score of benjamin britten's billy budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who played a legionnaire , bernardo montet .	2
they even increase your life three times because the movies tell us about things we could never possibly know .it lays out the grief facing a problematic family and we see it happening , but we never quite understand why ; and , we will have to accept as an answer that is because individuals are very complex and if they can't tell us what is on their mind , we can only guess what they are thinking .but one thing is certain , you can't put this iconoclastic filmmaker in a box and label him .	2
the film's theme is about how women are made to suffer in iran because of its harsh islamic laws against them , which makes all of their lives placed in the same never ending circle of repression .jafar panahi ( white balloon/the mirror ) , a disciple of abbas kiarostami , has created a devastatingly restrained powerhouse of a political film .this film conveys these dark feelings through a story without much of a plot or dialogue , yet brilliantly establishes the yearnings for freedom that these women have .	2
